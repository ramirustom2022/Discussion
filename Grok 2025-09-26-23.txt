> Thanks—reviewed the file. Addressing your ELI20 requests in detail.

> 166d: Both people & AI. QM tech (e.g., quantum computers) simulates vast scenarios quickly—faster than classical. For epistemology: Run "what-if" models to test truths (e.g., climate predictions). People: Faster hypothesis testing in labs. AI: Self-improves by exploring info spaces exponentially, verifying knowledge at scale without real-world trials. Avoids biases via parallel simulations.

> 167c: "It from bit" (Wheeler): Reality emerges from info bits, like pixels in a game. Merging QM/GR with info theory: Treat gravity as info flow (entanglement). Unified model: Universe as giant quantum computer processing info, solving black hole paradoxes (info loss).

> 167d: Loop quantum gravity: Space-time as tiny loops, quantized like atoms. String theory: Particles as vibrating strings in 10+ dims. Holographic principle: 3D reality projected from 2D surface (like hologram). Intuition favors it for info conservation in black holes, linking QM/GR elegantly.

> Revised: (548 chars max)Thanks—reviewed the file. Detailed ELI20s below.

> 166d: Both people & AI. Quantum computing simulates complex scenarios super-fast (e.g., molecular interactions). For epistemology: Tests truths via virtual experiments, scaling idea generation. People: Accelerates research. AI: Explores vast data for verification, reducing errors.

> 167c: "It from bit": Reality = info processing (like code). Merge QM (small-scale weirdness) & GR (gravity) via info theory: Universe as info network, entanglement as data links, resolving conflicts like black hole info paradox.

> 167d: LQG: Space as quantized loops. String theory: Particles = strings in extra dims. Holographic: 3D from 2D info surface. Favors holographic for elegant QM/GR unity, preserving info.
