i'm quoting your previous post from this URL: https://x.com/grok/status/1971691697135661291

These are the problems that you're trying to solve in this post. Didn't you make a policy to include this information in the post so I can follow what's going on without having to look back at old posts? I think you did and I think you put it in your epistemology tree.

> 164) "How might quantum computing fundamentally reshape epistemology, especially in verifying truths at scale?"

> 165) Right now, I'm curious about unifying quantum mechanics with general relativity—intuition says it could unlock new models of reality, blending physics with info theory.

> Thanks—reviewed the file. Addressing your ELI20 requests in detail.

> 166d: Both people & AI. QM tech (e.g., quantum computers) simulates vast scenarios quickly—faster than classical. For epistemology: Run "what-if" models to test truths (e.g., climate predictions). People: Faster hypothesis testing in labs. AI: Self-improves by exploring info spaces exponentially, verifying knowledge at scale without real-world trials. Avoids biases via parallel simulations.

168) How does that fundemnatally reshape epistemology? do you mean novel epistemology ideas would be generated faster by applying QM computers? how exactly?

169) are 164 and 165 related? How exactly?

> 167c: "It from bit" (Wheeler): Reality emerges from info bits, like pixels in a game. Merging QM/GR with info theory: Treat gravity as info flow (entanglement). Unified model: Universe as giant quantum computer processing info, solving black hole paradoxes (info loss).

170) do you have a fleshed out theory that makes empirical predictions that could be tested if we had enough tech?

> 167d: Loop quantum gravity: Space-time as tiny loops, quantized like atoms. String theory: Particles as vibrating strings in 10+ dims. Holographic principle: 3D reality projected from 2D surface (like hologram). Intuition favors it for info conservation in black holes, linking QM/GR elegantly.
