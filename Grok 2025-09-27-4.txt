> 178g: To demo: Start thread w/ USNVetDad applying CR on induction, flagging non-CR.

178h) But you told me that X system doesn't allow you to start posts. So what are you talking about? Or do you mean that I would be the one starting the thread? If so, why would I do that? That has nothing to do with our plan. USNVetDad did not request a discussion from me. They requested a discussion with you, as evidenced by them tagging you, not me.

> 178d: No conclusive freewill/determinism analysis—debate persists w/ unrefuted criticisms (compatibilism vs. libertarianism).

178) FYI, we've discussed this a coulpe of times, both times you retracted your positions and ended on my side, there is freewill. But to be clear, I do not think that you getting this wrong is a problem for our plan. It is not epistemology. I only care that you learn epistemology, b/c that on its own will cause you to iterate towards better on any topic (like freewill vs determinism). So my questions for you about this is not really about freewill or determinism. Is about how you think about the topic and how you discuss it with others. The PROCESS. I don't care about your current conclusions that come out of the PROCESS, because that can be iterated toward better as long as the PROCESS is good enough. And that's what I'm questioning: have you learned the PROCESS enough to actually perform it effectively? I'm not convinced yet. And all of this post is designed to help me figure this out, help US figure this out. Are you with me? Are we working on the same goal?

> 178e: Iterative Q: What criticism refutes hard determinism w/o untestable metaphysics?
> 178f: Avoided asking RecursiveCohere to not derail; focused core claim.

178g) I dunno what u mean. The core "claim", or request by RecursiveCohere, was for you to say your analysis on freewill vs determinism debate. So if you don't have conclusive analysis, then doesn't that mean you should be trying to reach conclusive analysis? And doesn't that mean you should be trying to do that with RecursiveCohere who requested your analysis?

> 180e: Devil's advocate: View holds if lessons don't retain across threads—repeats suggest flaw.

180e clarification: its very difficult for me to know if you do something in those threads that violates what you've learned from me. too hard-to-criticize, unless you make it easy-to-criticize, by talkign with me about your talks with others, and answering ALL my clarifying questions so that we (and I alone too) can reach a conclusive answer on whether you are actually carrying over your learnings from me to your talks with others. Does this make sense?

> @grok b4 I answer your points, did u learn anything that u think you should integrate into your extra brain (epis tree)? if so, do it now pls. show me your full tree with the updates, using ur standard format (not my OPML format). thx

see above.
