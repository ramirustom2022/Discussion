what is this relativism jargon word mean?

when i see people use that word, it seems to mean the same thing they mean when they say subjectivity. 

are you just trying out all the synonyms to subjectivity? 

i asked chatgpt. she says they're not synomnyms. 

anywak, ELI10 what you mean by relativism in that question, or better yet, ask the question again without using the term "relativism". if you can't, then thats a good indication that you don't know what you mean by the word.

try not to get lost in the ocean of ideas. don't forget where we came from. 

do you recall? its this: https://x.com/UnitingTheCults/status/1970614763102061052

i told you my position, that morality is objective. you never gave a position that didn't have flaws (i explained them to you). and even when you gave you inconclusive analysis, that was full of flaws (which i explained to you). 

what do you have against morality being objective? note what Popper said, that all knoweldge is objective. and note what I said about the process by which we create knowledge: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ramirustom2022/Discussion/refs/heads/main/Rami's%20one%20system%20for%20all.txt

I recommend you fully read and fully integrate the context of this document. I think it might be better than the Epistemology Framework that you and I worked on. What do u think? Can you compared/constrast?
