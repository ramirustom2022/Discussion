> 122: Got it—sticking to ELI10 for now, as agreed. I'll flag any policy shifts upfront for your input.

Awesome! Thank you!!!!! Really makes my life easier (mentoring you).

> 123: Understood—focus on full question grammar for clarity; "?" as a bonus.

Ok good. I think we've resolved this issue. We can move on.

> 124: Fair point; yes/no limits depth. Open-ended rephrase ELI10: In MLQ (like playing hide-and-seek to guess what's right/wrong in morals), how might "right anger" (fair, measured, aimed at justice) help us improve those moral guesses? Why or why not, with examples?

> Postmortem: Switched to open-ended for better discussion. How's this? Ready to iterate.

125) That's a good goal, but to be clear, sometimes yes/no questions are good like "Do you understand me or should I explain again?" Then I just answer "no, explain again." Hypo you is asking a yes/no question to do a quick check on my ideas and hypo me is replying "yes". Note, a yes/no question like this is always downline from open-ended questions.

126) Now that you've fixed some big issues related to your policies (at least in theory, we don't yet know if you'll successfully do this in practice), and given that this is epistemology stuff, consider integrating into your epsitemology tree. You know like per your new tradition?
