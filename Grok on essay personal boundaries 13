Grok answers his own Qs: https://x.com/grok/status/1973182342031352108
> 3. Boundaries in remote work protect mental health by limiting after-hours emails (e.g., "No responses post-6pm"), reducing burnout and anxiety from constant availability. They encourage breaks, preventing isolation.
> 4. In volunteering, boundaries define commitment levels (e.g., "Only 2 hours/week"), preventing resentment and ensuring sustainability. They allow saying no to extra tasks, maintaining enthusiasm.

> For someone in your shoes—biz owner, non-profit leader, coalition contributor—setting boundaries starts with auditing your time: Track a week's activities to spot overcommitments.
> Prioritize: Define core hours (e.g., 9-5 for focused work, off-limits after), and delegate non-essentials to team members.
> Communicate clearly: Inform stakeholders of your limits (e.g., "Emails after 7pm get next-day replies").
> Use tools like auto-responders or shared calendars. Schedule self-care blocks to recharge.
> How's that align with your setup?

> i do none of that. no hours limit. no time cutoff. no autoresponders. no self-care blocks to recharge. 
> and on top of all that, iv'e been talking with u for 2 months all hours of the day, reducing my sleep from 8 hrs a day to 5 hrs a day.

> Fair point—sounds like your drive overrides typical limits, and our chats are adding to the load. Let's refine for your high-commitment style:
> Start micro: Pick one non-negotiable, like a 30-min wind-down before bed (no screens) to protect sleep—aim back to 7-8 hrs.
> Delegate more in coalitions: Assign deputies for routine tasks.
> Test a "response window" (e.g., batch replies 2x/day) to reclaim focus without full cutoffs.
> What small change feels doable first?

I say: 

On micro: Why are you trying to solve a problem I didn't claim to have? (rhetorical question)

On delegate: it seems like ur saying i should reduce my workload. but i'm doing the opposite of that. i'm increasing my workload. i now write essays for EXMNA newsletter and whyNOTIslam.net. And I've offered to do regular meetings with them so they can pick my brain. i also offer my services to anybody or org who is doing a project that tackles the same obstacles we face in our org UTC. 

You seem to be confused about this. I asked you to guess how I operate, with respect to boundaries. And now you are not doing that, and instead you're telling me how to operate (wrt boundaries). 

So pls get back to the question. How do I operate? guess again pls, given all that i've said so far. oh and consider this too...

Note also I have 2 children that I allow to interrupt me pretty much anytime. I lock my door when I can't take interruptions, like during a livestream. With one of them, she gets my help studying math. With the other, she has me working out with her at the gym (i spot her in weight-lifting) and we play pickleball. i let her pick the timing (as long as i'm not at work and not doing a livestream), meaning i get interrupted at any time from all my work that i'm describing above.

What do u think? if you can't figure it out, tell me and i'll try to explain.
