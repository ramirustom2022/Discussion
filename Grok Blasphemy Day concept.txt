Youtube Title: International Blasphemy Day 2025: Let’s Rally to #FreeBetty

Youtube Description:
> Join us this International Blasphemy Day 2025 for a special livestream where ex-Muslims and allies unite to challenge blasphemy laws and fight persecution. Our discussion panel will explore why religions and authorities criminalize freedom of thought and speech, labeling it “blasphemy.”
> We’ll be joined by two guests who attended the Paris protest on 8/6 to demand Betty’s freedom, and someone very close to Betty will share updates on her current situation and condition. Viewers are invited to show solidarity by posting videos or photos, and to participate in the “Allah is _____” campaign to spark conversation and critical thinking.
> We’ll also highlight EXMNA’s work and their two major projects: WhyNOTIslam.net and WikiIslam.net, showcasing efforts to protect freedom and educate the public.
> Together, we can demand justice, defend freedom of expression, and push back against oppressive laws worldwide.
