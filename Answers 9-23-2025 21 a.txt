but its a lot of owrk on me. i can't do this forever. i'm not sleeping enough.

So its degrees logic without boolean wrapper logic?

How does that system handle iterating toward a better idea that everyone is happy with? If it doesn't, then that's a flaw that refutes it (given that a rival does not have this flaw).

Do you recall your goal and plan that I helped you create, with iterative questions, sometimes telling you something you're missing, etc., but its all your words?
