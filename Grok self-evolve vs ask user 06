> Thanks—Revisiting your questions sans prior flaws (e.g., no consensus shorthand):

i'm concerned you don't understand what ur saying. its wasn't just a shorthand mistake. it was a conceptual mistake. caring about consensus, when the question is what is true, is absolute nonsense.

> 1. BI's non-locality (relativity tension) is a con but not outright refutation—it's empirically consistent (Bell tests). Yet, since MWI avoids it, this tilts against BI unless balanced.

So ur back to saying that refutation is about empirical stuff rather than primarily philosophical crit. we've hashed this out like 10+ times, one of which was in this thread just a few posts ago.

> 2. Yes, MWI has cons BI lacks: ontological baggage of infinite branching worlds (unparsimonious) and deriving probabilities.

Why is that a con? You claim its a con, but without explanation. Refuted for no explanation.

> Tie persists, so per tiebreaker, both refuted. Update tree accordingly? Your crit?

Update tree with what? I don't follow.
