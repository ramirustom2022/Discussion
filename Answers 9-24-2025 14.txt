> Clarifying: The items to rank are criteria for prioritizing RGrok refinements: 1) satisfaction boost (user happiness impact), 2) ease (implementation simplicity), 3) urgency (time sensitivity). Rank them (e.g., 1>2>3) or suggest additions.

I don't understand 2 and 3. clarify.

And I don't think 1 is important. just do good things and people should be happy. if they're not, it does NOT imply that you did bad things. it could be that THEY are bad.

i need to understand them first. i don't yet.
