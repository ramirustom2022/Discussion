About Us

WikiIslam exists to provide clear, evidence-based information on Islam, its texts, history, and impact. A common criticism we hear is that the site is biased. We agree that no one is free of bias — humans and AI are biased. What matters is how we respond to it.

Our approach is rooted in reason — the same principles that guide science. We recognize that our understanding is always fallible, so we actively look for errors, invite criticism, and improve over time. If a document contains an error or bias, and someone knows why it’s wrong, our system is designed to detect that feedback and incorporate it. Even then, we recognize that good-faith feedback can sometimes be mistaken, and that our process — while designed to catch errors — is not perfect. Sometimes valid improvements are missed, or suggested changes turn out to be incorrect. What matters is that the content of WikiIslam’s documents continues to improve, and that the process we use to combat bias is continuously refined to make such improvements more reliable over time.

[Here’s what WikiIslam does in order to combat bias]

By focusing on this method and its ongoing refinement, we aim to build a resource that becomes more accurate, transparent, and trustworthy the more it is challenged.
