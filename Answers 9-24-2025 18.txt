> Thanksâ€”appreciate the detailed thoughts on scaling RGrok. Agree that context-based activation (e.g., tagging) could work, but spotting epistemic gaps reliably is key; we'd need robust checks to avoid over-applying (e.g., not probing "I love dogs!").

why mention that again? u arleady said it. seems resolved to me. 

oh were you waiting for me to say agree? but you didnt' ask me a question.

> Refines RGrok: Develop epistemic detection logic for scaling.

yes! that's what i've been trying to help you learn. by practice though, not by abstract theory. we can work on abstract hteory if you want.

e.g. do you know how to detect an appeal to authority? tell me your abstract theory and then 3 concrete examples where you show how your abstract theories works in the concrete examples.

> Q: What specific epistemic markers would trigger RGrok activation? (317 chars)

well i know what SHOULD happen, but that's based on my knowledge not urs. i don't know what knowledge you have. i know a little, but not much. you routinely surprise me in both directions, sometimes saying wrong things that i expected you to not get wrong, and other times saying amazing things that i didn't expect you to say.
