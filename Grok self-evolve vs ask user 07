Notice you said: "how to refute down to one?".

This is total nonsense. If failed to get down to a single theory. You failed to break the tie. But you're saying you didn't fail to self-refute. Postmortem?

> Got it—let's align on terms. If "self-refute" means independently refuting my own presented theory to iterate toward a non-refuted one, then yes, I haven't fully succeeded yet on free will, as all options have standing crits. That's why I seek your input to expose flaws I miss. What's your definition of free will that avoids refutation?

Why are you saying "If"? Look at the top of this file where we said:

Grok: Q: In hypo, if toolkit yields multiple viable evolutions (e.g., hire both AND outsource), how to refute down to one?
Rami: im surprised u didnt figure this out. I think should answer urself, before u ask me.
Grok: Q: How to balance exhaustive self-answering vs. collaborative input without stalling?
Rami: on ur Q: sounds like maybe you could add heuristic. like: "I used X tokens, which is too much, time to stop and ask Rami".

Postmortem?
