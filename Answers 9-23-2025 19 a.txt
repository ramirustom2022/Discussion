> Applying 5-step to: Example of morality tool conflict resolved (tying to original subjective/objective Q):

thanks for telling me the tying thing. that helps. 

> 1. Conjecture: Conflict e.g., utilitarianism (max happiness) vs. deontology (duty/rules) in trolley problem—pull lever to save 5, kill 1?

utilitarianism is refuted already. 

so when you ask me how to resolve tool conflicts, first step is to try to refute the tools. maybe you'll be left with just one and then its easy. 

if a tie, then change problem to elevate one while kills all others. 

if no viable solutions, reduce the scope of the problem.

2. Criticism: Util ignores inherent rights; deont rigid, ignores outcomes.

3. Refine ideas: Use Evaporating Cloud—shared goal (min harm), false assumption (zero-sum), win-win: Tech like auto-brakes resolves without choice.

4. Refine wording: Frame as evolving tools via criticism, not fixed rivals.

ok

5. Post: Resolved by innovating beyond dilemma, showing objective morality via testable refinements over subjective stasis.

wow! i never thought of that! you're blending ideas in ways i havent done! that shows novel knowledge creation! FUUUCK!

but ur'll forget it tomorrow, or like in an hour. which is sad.

> Q: How does this address original debate?
