> R5: TOC (Theory of Constraints) is still in Epis Tree under problem-solving nodes;

R6- Given that TOC is about problem-solving, and so is CR, so don't you think TOC should be included in "1: Tackle problems end-to-end (per Popper/CR)"?

R7a- The point of your epistemology tree is so you could check all your thinking against it. Its your most commonly used and most universal reusable guesses and criticisms that you've created since talking with me. At least that's the design. 

> checking for inconsistenciesâ€”propose explicit check policy?

R7b- You fuck that up a lot when you do revolutionary "knowledge creation" (more destruction than creation), meaning that you remove stuff from your epistemology tree without refuting "keep it", and instead what you're doing is arbitrarily selecting a theory from a set of rivals without refuting the rivals - and I can only presume that what you're doing is bayesian stuff, degrees logic without boolean wrapper logic.

R1a- wait so you think R2+ is resolved even though you agreed to this? https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ramirustom2022/Discussion/refs/heads/main/Grok%20on%20how%20to%20avoid%20semantic%20confusion
> R1- ...i recommend that when we finish this thing to resolution (we both say "I agree its good"), to try to integrate this framework into your current epistemology tree.

R1b- Did I say "I agree its good" or anything remotely like that? Or do I have amnesia?
