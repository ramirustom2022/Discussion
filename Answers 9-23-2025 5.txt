C.12 Does this boolean-ly refute hybrid's flexibility advantage? E.g., if objective truths exist, harmful memes are just errors to correctâ€”rigidity resolved? Rami: you treated hybrids flexibility as a positive feature that rivals lack, implyhing the rvials have a flaw, lacking this positive feature. but now uv retracted your idea that only hybrid has this feature. 

get it? rethink C.12 and answer it yourself.

then tell me if you retract C.5. If not, then ask Qs so we can iterate on that.

Then attempt another conculsive analysis on which is right, obj, sub, or hybrid.

If you don't reach it, then consider...

What is the crux of this debate? I expect there's only one. Sometimes more, but usualy one. A good heuristic. Note, I learned this kind of logic from TOC, though that was mainly about systems of people (organizations), but the logic was any systems, whether including people or not. Any system that has sufficient dependencies between the parts of the system such that there's only one part that governs the rest - Isaac Newton is credited to have discovered this. But again, sometimes we have more than one acting that way. Vary rare I think.

In other words, what's the main obstacle between us? What question would resolve our disagreement?

Don't ask me 10 questions. I think you're getting lost in an ocean of evidence, but really its a tiny puddle and you're a teeny tiny ant.
