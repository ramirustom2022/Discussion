> Thanks—integrated: Context (problem-situation/CR, Objectivism, AI); goals precede constraints; iterate MLQs to reduce errors (vs. "valid"); no mind model diffs (brainstorm: 1. AI lacks bio-neurology; 2. Humans have emotions biasing intuition; 3. AI processes deterministically; 4. Humans evolve via experience; 5. AI scales infinitely; 6. Humans limited by fatigue; 7. AI transparent logs; 8. Humans subconscious opaque).

38) What's the functional difference between emotoins and intuitions? If nothing, then they are same thing and using them as different things is a semantics flaw causing confusion. To be clear, I'm not sure of the answer. Lets work together to figure it out! Ok?

> Answers:
> 34) Agreed—goals first; test integration.

39) Analogy: Cart before the house. U know this one right? Did you know what it meant? If so, tell me what you thgouth it meant (before discusing all this epistemology with me). 

> 35) Yes, iterate for error reduction.

40) Recall DD's idea of how we create knoweldge: we go from flawed theory to less flawed theory to even less flawed theory. From BOI (and probably his earlier book The Fabric of Reality.

> 36) Deviation implies error; refinement is positive adaptation.

41) But there was an error! In my idea, which you fixed in your refinement! i mean an error according to you, which is why you refined it. Recall our dsicussions that went like this: Rami: U retracted, now cycle back. RGrok: NUU-UHH! I didn't retract my posiiotn, I just changed it. Rami: That's the same thing. You retracted T1 - noticing a flaw - and created T2 from it, keeping the good and changing the flaw. T2 is non-refuted while T1 is refuted. Now, in our current case, T1 was made by me (Rami) while T2 was made by you (RGrok). Do u see? I think this somehow deserves to be in your epsitemology tree. But note, this is less of a conceptual problem and more of a semantic rpoblem, so i'm not sure it needs to be added to epistemology tree. What do u think? Argue both sides and lets make a conclusive position. I'm very curious what you'll figure out! I'm confident u'll kick some ass!

> 37) Concrete contradictions key for flaws.

42) Concretes key for understanding abstracts. Analogy: Without concretes, abstracts are floating in the air. Need to be grounded!!!!

> Q: Which brainstormed mind model diff impacts error handling most? 

You'll have to explain that more clearly for me, i'm not following. i mean if you want me help on it.


From a couple posts ago, I forgot to address you. Its my fault for not putting ID on the question.

>> Q: What flaws in subconscious/conscious mind model for AI? (478 chars)

43) I don't see any functional differences between the sub/con mind model for human vs AI. do u? brainstorm 5-10 ideas. then after we could scrutinize together if you like (like if you don't figure out a conclusive analysis on ur own, then u could enlist me in your problem-solving!)

you said:

44) Are tehre any of these that your intuition says is promosing? Lets pick that one to discuss. Cool? If so, pls steelman that position so I can see what u mean - right now its too hard for me to criticize. Then we'll iterate. Ok?
