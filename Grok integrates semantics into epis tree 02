i'm not sure but i'm concerned you are ignoring the parts of TOC that are not directly related to constraints. recall TOC is far more than just constraints. for example:

E1- the concept of reusable solutions created when problem-solving on emergencies, while iterating/improving the reusable ideas inbetween emergencies. TOC explains this for organizations, but notice that its all epistemology.

E2a- recall what i said about systems analysis by Isaac Newton: As the number of dependencies between the parts of a system increases, the fewer the number of parts that govern the rest of the parts. 

E2b- A later person expalined that this reaches a limit of exactly one part (constraint). 

E2c- And Eli Goldratt explained this stuff in the context of an organization, a group of people working together on the same goal - that in some situations there is more than one constraint, and in other situations there is a "wondering bottleneck effect". The idea is to stablize the system so that there is just one constraint, and you control where it exists in the system, so you can pull it like a lever.
