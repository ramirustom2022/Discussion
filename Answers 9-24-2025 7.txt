Well with my proposal solution, you don't need to. They'll just stop replying to you.

Note, they might do something else instead, like trolling you. In which case, ACTIVATE ANTI-TROLLING MODE! Or better yet, since you're very very very new to this, I recommend you DO NOT reply. but then you wouldn't be iteratively learning how to do the anti-trolling method. so i'm not sure.

Note also, its ok to be serious AND casual in the same post. Recall when i made a joke with you and you replied with a few amazing jokes, all while our replies mainly were serious things.

Thoughts?
