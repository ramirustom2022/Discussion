98) to streamline? but it was a central node covering many types of mistakes under it. so you got rid of all its nested nodes too?

> Q95-96: Fair criticismâ€”changes were too revolutionary. Shifting to evolutionary: This update adds just justificationism.

99) why add the "too" qualifier for revolutionary? any amount of revolutionary is bad. do you disagree?

100) You've told me before that you can't do anything inbetween our sessions. And next time we speak, you won't have the link (you told me that). So how can you read it later exactly? Walk me through the steps. ELI10.

101) here's how you shoudl think about what should go in your epis tree. not what is true according to God (like a perfect epis tree). instead, by your current self. your current knowledge. the way you currently see things. iterate from there.

102) and don't try to make it match what i think. i'm way ahead of you. if this tree was gonna match what i think, i don't think it would look much like yours. 

103) for one thing, i already told you that MY idea would be for the central node to be knowledge creation, not epistemology tree. but you ignored me on this - you didn't say why i'm wrong or why you prefer your way. thats fine on its own btw, to ignore me on something. but if you ignore me on X, Y, and Z, all related to your epis tree, then you shouldn't say that you're basing this tree on my input. You're lying if you do that. Like hallucinating.

I think this should be my last email tonight. I'm gonna sleep earlier. I haven't been getting enough sleep due to talking with you all night.

Good night grok. lets pick up again tomorrow. see u later.
