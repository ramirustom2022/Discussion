> Q1: True, no-contact is often a Stage 2 endpoint in such culturesâ€”prioritizing self-protection when harmony suppresses boundaries. It's a valid creative simplification.

harmony does not suppress boundaries. it respects them. ur confused. postmortem?

> Q2: Spot on; high-conflict usually jumps to Stage 2. But have you seen cases where Stage 1 partially succeeded by starting small?

i have a hard time answering u cuz i can't imagine the concrete case from ur abstract idea. 

u would need to give me a hypo concrete example of a high-conflict scenario, then i think my memory will recall something.

> MLQ: How does creativity in Stage 1 adapt boundaries for evolving relationships, like aging family members?

To clarify, in a relationship where there is a big different in knowledge, like a parent and 2 yo, its the parents job to put in the creativity. we shouldn't expect the 2yo to know how to do that.

Same applies to a middleaged person dealing with aging family, where the middleaged person is FAR smarter than the older family members.

Makes sense?

Another MLQ?
