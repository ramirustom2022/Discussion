132) Going forward, pls make it crystal clear what problem we're trying to solve. Don't expect me to try to recall past posts. It makes it harder for me and for you. Causes more confusion. To avoid the confusion, always state the problem we're trying to solve. 

133) Notice that this is the same as: cart before the horse logic. If you don't restate the problem and you just continue talking about criticisms and stuff, we could easily forget what the problem was that we're trying to solve. We have to always have the horse infront of the cart!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So let me add it now based on my memory (tell me if I got it wrong):

Problem: we're trying to figure out whether (epistemology) revolution is ever a good thing, and you're using example of Newton/Maxwell->Einstein as a case of revolutionary knowledge creation - and we're trying to judge whether you're right about that.

> 131: Einstein's path (from his 1949 Notes, 1905 Annalen paper, biographies): Began ~1895 (age 16) with gedankenexperiment: pursuing light beam at c yields "frozen" EM wave, contradicting Maxwell's eqs (wave eq. requires oscillation in any frame). Probed asymmetry: moving magnet near coil induces current (Faraday), but moving coil near magnet implies emf from Lorentz force—explanations differ by frame, violating relativity principle (Galilean then).

> Rejected luminiferous ether (post-Michelson-Morley null, 1887). Tried emission theory (light speed c+v relative source), but failed: contradicts stellar aberration (Bradley, 1728; apparent star position shifts with Earth's velocity, fits wave but not ballistic). Also clashed with de Sitter's binary star observations (1913, but Einstein anticipated inconsistencies).

> Crisis peaked 1905: Influenced by Mach (critique of absolute space/time), Hume (causality, ideas from associations), Poincaré (conventional simultaneity). Key talk with Besso: Realized time coord. depends on frame—simultaneity not absolute. Adopted postulates: 1) Laws identical in inertial frames; 2) c invariant.

> Derived: Lorentz transforms from light clock thought exp. (time dilation), length contraction, E=mc². Built in ~5 weeks, but gestation 10 yrs of iterative failures/refinements.

First I'll say I don't really understand what you said. But I don't blame you. I blame my lack of knowledge on this. But let me tell you the very little that I recall. And I think it fits nicely into what you said, but you check me on this ok?

Einstein did a thought experiment of a moving train and shining light forward. Using Newton's logic, the light would be going the speed of the light + the speed of the train. But Einstein knows that light speed if fixed. So this is a contradiction beween Newton's logic and empirical evidence. So he needs to resolve the conflict.

Also, Einstein see a contradiction between Maxwell's logic on EM and empirical evidence. And he needed to solve that contradiction too!

Another angle is this: Newton's gravity and Maxwell's EM contradict each other. 

Einstein's solution resolved all 3 contradictions!

Do you agree with me so far? Do you have any clarifications that you think would improve my view? (I'm trying to learn to, not just you.)

> Aligns with evolutionary view? Your take.

I do think so but what do u think? Let me ask a question to help you think about it.

134) Can you imagine a smaller step iterating from Newton's gravity or Maxwell's EM to Einstein's relativity? If not, then what makes you think this process deviates from step-check-step? In other words, what multiple steps did Einstein do that you're implying he didn't check individual steps inbetween?

> Postmortem: Detailed at bachelor's level; sourced from primaries. Ready to dive deeper? (512 chars)

Yep see above.
