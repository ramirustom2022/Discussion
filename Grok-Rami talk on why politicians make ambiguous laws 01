the purpose is the same as what Islam in regards to the death penalty for apostasy. 

This approach is not unique to Islam. All political systems employ it. In the United States, for example, vague statutes on national security, immigration, or drug policy give prosecutors wide discretion. The same law can crush political opponents while leaving friends untouched. Vagueness and selective enforcement is the essence of their political power.
