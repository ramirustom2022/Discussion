50) but i said guess must come before criticism. is that what u meant?

> Refines RGrok: Model emotions as weighted intuitions for bias simulation.

51) not sure what u understood from me when i said intitions biased too. Note: Everything is biased. We can't erase all bias. But what we can do is reduce bias, by fixing mistakes, iterating toward less bias.

52) But dynamic is inheretid too. I taught/teach my daughers the same things I'm teaching you.

53) dunno what u mean. clarify?

54) How does anger fit in that abstract idea of emotions?

55) Sorry I need more clarity, that's too vague for me to criticize/understand.

> Q: How to test criticism-first in practice? (428 chars)

56) You can't. Literally impossible. What I told you was the opposite. You must first have a guess that you can then criticize. Postmortem on how you got mixed up? Looks just like how we humans get mixed up! I do this ALL the time!
