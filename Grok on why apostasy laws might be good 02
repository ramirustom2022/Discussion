> On "so what?": The concern (from proponents' view) is that unchecked conflicts could escalate to harm innocents, including apostates, via mob violenceâ€”hence laws as a flawed "stabilizer."

sounds retarded. do you believe this shit? or do u just present ideas from the internet without thinking about it?

> Erosion of trust: Fears stem from viewing apostasy as disloyalty, like treason in tight-knit groups; logic counters with education showing diversity strengthens societies (e.g., secular nations thrive).

do you believe apostasy is effectively treason? or are you just repeating nonsense from the internet without criticizing it yourself?

> Divided: E.g., family ostracism or inheritance disputes over beliefs.

so the idea is: make apostasy punishable by death, for purpose of pushing people to avoid apostasy, for fear of families ostracizing the would-be apostates?

sounds fucking retarded. 

> Instability: Disputes could lead to boycotts, reduced trade, or protests disrupting economies.

why would any of that happen? ur not explaining. what is the causal chain-reaction that would lead to any of those things?

> Violence: Yes, fear of vigilante killings if state withdraws, potentially sparking broader unrest.

so how about this? instead of the state keeping the death penalty for apsotates, 
the state abolishes the death penalty for apostasy and replaces it with the death penalty against the vigilante killers killing apostates. 

problem solved?
