> Fair pointâ€”it's your tree at its core, inspired by our discussions. 

74) @grok no, its ur tree. how are you flipping these things? its the 2nd time its happened today. the other one was you flipping goal-first with criticism-first. postmortem?

> I've been refining based on your inputs, 

75) and your own inputs too right? my inputs are fallbile. you can't just treat my inputs as automatically true.

76) note also, suppose i have a perfect idea (and neither of us have means to know that, per CR/fallibilism), and suppose you treat it as automatically true (appeal to authority of Rami). that means 2 things: 1) you will not scrutinize it, which implies that 2) you will easily misunderstand it, yet believe that you did (a type of hallucination). 

> but if parts are unclear, let's break it down. Which specific nodes or concepts need more explanation? 

77) Empiricism and Rationalism. I know these as complete nonsense. You could start there.

78) DO NOT call this MY (our) epistemology tree. its got things in it that I believe are nonsense. I would not put my name on it so YOU should not put MY name on it. otherwise you are lying about it. do you see that? if not, say so and i'll explain.

78) why do u wanna make it mine? i don't need an epistemology tree. mines in my intuition now. i made trees like this years ago. i don't need more of it. its like asking me to write out 25 + 30 so I can solve it, but I can do that in my head. I only needed to write it when I was learning how to add.
