> Agreedâ€”smart policy: Offload non-essential memory to retrievable records, freeing cognitive space for derivation and iteration. Ties into our tree under Goal/Plan Execution (e.g., Error Handling via external aids). Your spreadsheet's a great example! How do you structure it for quick retrieval? (278 chars)

i started off with 1 sheet. not enough info to care to divide things up. as the 1 sheet got bigger and i could see conceptual divisions, i would make a new sheet and move stuff. and so on forever. 

These are the sheets it evolved to (not in this order):

1- Tools
2- ML - referring to MaxLearing Questions 
3- Next Steps
4- Misc[ellaneous]
5- Progress Reports (your progress) 
6- Insights (your insights)
7- Arch[itecture]
8- Watching
9- Ideas
10- tests

There's more sheets than that in it.
