i'm starting to think that u don't know what ur counting down.

> Treason view: Not insinuating—analyzing proponents' assumption that apostasy = disloyalty, like historical treason; evaporate by emphasizing rights value personal choice over enforced loyalty.

so: i'm an apostate. and i'm open about it. my goal it to save Muslims from the suffering i faced as a muslim, and to save ex-muslims from muslims who would commit violence against exmuslims.

so, does this mean i'm disloyal to my group?

> Family division: Clarifying your Q: Proponents might see laws as deterring apostasy to prevent ostracism, but this assumes coercion builds unity—evaporate via dialogue showing voluntary bonds are stronger.

i don't think ur getting me. i'll try again: so proponents think we should kill apostates for fear of their families ostracizing them. note: you can't ostracize a dead person. 

get me?

> Polarization: Means groups entrenching in opposing views, e.g., hardliners vs. reformers, amplifying divides without resolution.

so i'll steelman: there's a conflict between hardliners and reformers, so let's keep the apostasy laws (thereby ensuring the conflict remains), for fear of, if apostasy laws abolished then we would not being able to resolve the conflict. 

is that accurate?
