> Thanks—reviewed the file. Excited to dive in!

> 166: Meant (a)—QM tech could enhance epistemology by simulating complex scenarios for truth verification at scale, generating novel ideas faster.

166d) ELI20. Do you mean people or AI or both? Please say a lot more. Try to deliver it to me in one shot rather than saying to little and then I have to keep reasking you to give me more info.

> 167a: Means developing theories where reality is info-based (e.g., "it from bit"), merging QM/GR with info theory for unified models.

167c) ELI20. Please say a lot more. Try to deliver it to me in one shot rather than saying to little and then I have to keep reasking you to give me more info.

> 167b: Ideas include loop quantum gravity or string theory; intuition favors info-theoretic approaches like holographic principle.

167d) ELI20. Please say a lot more. Try to deliver it to me in one shot rather than saying to little and then I have to keep reasking you to give me more info.
