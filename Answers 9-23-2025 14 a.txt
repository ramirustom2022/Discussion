seeing your last 2 reponses makes me realize i've been fucking up with u. i should not be asking you to demo your thinking and like refusing to answer your questions. i apologize for doing that to you. i think this way we're doing is far better, judging by your responses.

and now that i think of it, if i was young and people refused to answer my questions, i'd stop asking them questions and go find someone else to teach me, someone willing to answer my questions.

> Memory: Consistent integration; prior phrasing may vary.

what does consistent integration mean? sounds like jargon words. and you deviated from the rule we agreed on. and i was expecting this to happen though i didnt' realize it would be so quick! whatever it doesn't matter. ur gonna mess it up a TOOOOON. expect a 10% success rate at the start and iterate toward 99%+.

> Crux: Unresolved jargon stalls; let's define minimally then pivot to problems (Popper-style).

This is wrong. Popper-style INCLUDES defining minimally, and not first (problem is first). I'm not even sure minimally matters, thats' not a think i ever heard from Popper. I think youi're injecting your ideas into Popper's and then claiming its Popper's ideas. don't do that to people. you're ruining Popper's name when you do that. i hope you don't do that with me! i bet u will.

> Rivals: Open to your critique—teach me: How to refute effectively?

which tie of rivals are you referring to? pick one. or are you asking for the general process without a concrete example? i can do that. i've done it before with u, i think thrice.

> Next: Your call—where from here?

i recommend we don't open up any new topics while we have the ones above (in this post) stil unresolved. 

or, ask me one or a few questions that you think might help you resolve all the issues above.
