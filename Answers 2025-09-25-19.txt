> Too Popper-centric: Over-relying on Popper/Deutsch's critiques, potentially sidelining other epi traditions (e.g., Bayesianism or coherentism) that address similar flaws differently.

87) Bayesianism (aka Bayesian epistemology) is complete nonsense. bayes theorem is sense. recall: deegres logic without boolean wrapper logic is bad. but with it is fine.

88) what's coherentism? never heard of it. educate me. your statement with this undefined jargon is vague, too hard to criticize. should be rejected for this reason.

> Steelman: This framing biases the tree by presenting CR as the sole resolver, ignoring how empiricism's data-driven approach or rationalism's logical rigor contribute uniquely—making the tree incomplete or dogmatic.

89) You are implying that CR is NOT a data-driven approach. It is. More so than empricism claims to be. Data comes in the criticism step of guesses and criticism.

90) You are implying that CR is NOT logically rigorous. It is. More so than rationalism claims to be.

91) Empricism and rationalism have flaws that CR does not have. Everyting that is good in empricsm and rattionalism are already in CR. I told you this already FYI in my last reply (phrased differently). I said:

> 86) I think what ur doing is Empricism+Rationalism = good. But that's not how ideas work. You can't just add them together, concetenate them. They contradict each other! You would have to resolve the contradicts. And guess what, Popper already did that, and he gave his system a name, Critical Rationalism.

92) Do you see how 86 and 91 are saying the same exact thing?

> Scrutinize: Yet CR explicitly builds on/critiques those, aiming for fallibilism; adding branches for alternatives could enrich without diluting.

Not sure what u mean, but i'm guessing you'll have new ideas after reading 86/89/90/91/92.

> Pure induction: Induction without theory-laden priors (naive data-to-theory). Vs. general induction (any inference from instances). Not saving it—Popper shows it's impossible/illogical. Thoughts on integration? (487 chars)

93) Can't answer the integratoin question until i understand. and i don't yet. Do u mean both pure induction and general induction are refuted?
