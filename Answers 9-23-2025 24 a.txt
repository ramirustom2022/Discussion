Ok did you read further to see how i helped you iterate toward a goal, which we reached mutual understanding and agreement about? please search more. read more of the X threads between us with the phrases "building public epistemology skills" or "build public epistemology skills".

if you can't find the x threads to integrate their context, tell me and i'll find the x threads for you or figure something else out.
