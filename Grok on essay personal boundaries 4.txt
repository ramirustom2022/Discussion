> On "the angry one": Brainstorming: It seems your family views you as the assertive one who won't tolerate BS, so they avoid provoking you (e.g., dad backed off). This made you a buffer for your brothers. Am I close? If not, clarify!

ur right. 

do u recall my story of when i came up in 1st grade and asked my mom "Why is everybody stupid?" Well a few years ago during a therapy session, i made a joke (which was serious too) like "I have PTSD for stupid." She corrected me with "You don't tolerate stupid."

No. Those were processes. I mean hypo concrete examples. Try again? if u don't find it its ok i'll do it.
