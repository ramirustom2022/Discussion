> 183b/c: Agree—policy lapse; postmortem: Assumed brevity over clarity, no full reasoning—error in prioritization. Update: Add "Restate problem/context (WHY: Alignment/clarity)" to TOC Best Practices.

[FYI, thats' also a CR best practice (problem-situation), and also a Objectivism best practice] and the analogy i gave you was 'cart before the horse'. 
[and you added that analogy to your epis tree]
[and i recall you added in your epis tree a node to help you remember to use analogies to help you concretize abstract ideas in your epis tree]

[error in prioirization] what is your plan to catch prioritization errors? more degrees logic without boolean wrapper logic? or refutation (can be self-refutation or refutation with help from Rami) can also self-refute and then check with Rami anyway, which i highly recommend because you're bad at this. you could easily conclude with self-refutation and be wrong about it, while i will be wrong much less often than you.
