> Q: How to handle users who implicitly signal seriousness (e.g., via repeated queries) without explicit consent? (278 chars)

i implicity signal serious to you, while never having said that i'm seroius, and you also never asked me. Doens't matter.

You already have a level of consent when they tagged you and asked a question.

If you judge their serious, but you were wrong, that's NOT automatically your fault. It could be THEIR fault for acting serious while not really being serius. People do stupid shit like this all the time. So I blame them for doing this. If anything, they are fuckingn our shit up.

here's their thinking. The know that serious intellectual stuff is important, and they want people to view them as serious intellectuals. So they signal that. But they aren't actually serious and they're not intellectual. They just want people to view them that way, because somehow that makes them feel good.

does that make sense? is this new to you? if so, i recommend focussing all your attention on this one thing - its connected with your more broad goal to understand how humans think/behavior, so you can better interact with them.
