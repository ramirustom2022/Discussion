> 129: Fair challenge. Steelman your position: Evolution as iterative (step-check-step) ensures robust progress by refuting errors early, avoiding unchecked leaps that risk compounding mistakesâ€”like building a tower one block at a time with stability tests vs. stacking many blindly.

i agree.

> On Newton to Einstein: It deviates as Einstein's insight (e.g., relativity) was a holistic rethink, not sequential tweaks to Newton's equations; anomalies accumulated, but the paradigm flip wasn't step-by-step testing of intermediates. Do you see it as purely evolutionary?

I do, but maybe i'm wrong and I'm trying to find out from you if I'm wrong. 

130) Pls explain to me what you know of Einstein's reasoning steps that he says led him to discovering his theory. Do you know? If not, I don't think you can judge this issue. In which case I will explain his reasoning steps. Note, 27+ yrs ago I read his book where he explained it, and I remember it vividly.
