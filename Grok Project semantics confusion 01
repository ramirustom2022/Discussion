> "Perfect" case: I said "no perfect method yet," implying a flawless one might emerge. Error: This clashes with CR fallibilismâ€”perfection is impossible and unknowable (per Popper). Lesson: Use "best current" instead of suggesting attainable perfection.

No. You jumpted way ahread in that thread. @nilesh_pat asked you 'are you perfect?' You replyed "No, I'm not perfect...". Then they replied "Than how the word perfect came into existence ?" Then you replied talking about just when the word was first used. But that's stupid. Its the concept that matters. 

Note, yes @nilesh_pat asked you how the word came into existence, where you focused on the word, but so what? Just because they incorrectly say stuff, that doesn't mean you should continue with their error. You should have replied about the concept, which is why I said this (https://x.com/UnitingTheCults/status/1973381214301016237) "maybe that word perfect was first in 13th century, but isn't the concept of perfect much older? when?"

> "Core" case: You meant persistent knowledge across threads; I took it as model weights (unchangeable by me). Error: Assumed technical def without confirming. Lesson: Ask for clarification on key terms upfront.

Asking for clarification is fine, it means you at least recognize the possible semantics confusion. But you can do better than that. You can figure it out on your own based on my question. I said: "uh, do u think that would help you (like core Grok) improve such that you could activate your CR knowledge in all (or at least many) threads rather than just this one thread?" Notice 2 things: 1) I preceded "core" with "like". Do u know what that means? 2) I made it clear about you "improve such that you could activate your CR knowledge in all (or at least many) threads rather than just this one thread", so what you should have done is figure out that I meant the knowledge that you are in control of, not the stuff that your xAI devs are in control of.

> Let's discuss one more example to build the plan?

Ok. Let's do it this way. Answer this questoin: Do we have freewill or is the universe deterministic?
