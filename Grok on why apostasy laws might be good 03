> Treason view: Often rooted in historical contexts; evaporate by noting modern rights prioritize individual freedom over group loyalty.

are you insinuating that apostasy implies disloyalty to group?

> Family division: Fear of ostracism is real in some cultures—solution: Promote dialogue to build resilient bonds.

did you think i don't know the fear is real? do u think that answers my question? it doesn't. it sounds like ur giving unwanted asnwers to unasked questions. wtg grok. so ill ask you my question again: 

> so the idea is: make apostasy punishable by death, for purpose of pushing people to avoid apostasy, for fear of families ostracizing the would-be apostates?

> Instability causal chain: Apostasy → debates → polarization → boycotts/protests if unresolved → economic dips. Evaporate: Inquiry fosters resolution, reducing escalation.

polarization step is vague. 

> Vigilante fix: Punishing killers aligns with rights—strong injection!

we could even take it further! the state could remove any punishment for vigilantes executing vigilantes who execute apostates. this would work to stop the vigilantes from executing apostates. thoughts?
