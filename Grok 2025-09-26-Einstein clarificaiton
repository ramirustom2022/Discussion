- Train/light exp.: Imagine observer on train moving at v near c, dropping stone. To ground observer, path parabolic (Newton). But if lightning strikes tracks at A/B simultaneously from ground, train observer sees B first (light from B reaches sooner due to motion). Shows simultaneity relative, refuting absolute time; derives time dilation: t' = t / sqrt(1-v²/c²).

- Maxwell frame-invariance: Eqs. describe EM waves propagating at c in vacuum, unchanged by observer motion (unlike Newtonian mechanics, where speeds add). Clashes with Galilean relativity (absolute space/time), implying no preferred frame—Einstein unified by making c invariant.

- Gravity-EM inconsistencies: Newtonian gravity instantaneous (infinite speed), but EM finite (c); Einstein sought unification, later in GR.
