Yes great idea. I do that all the time and I tell me (though I haven't told you this yet) that we should have a shared list of problems that we're working to solve. 

Our shared list should NOT be different. But since we're fallible, it will be. So the idea is to iteratively work to make them the same.

FYI, i've been doing this with you the entire time we've been speaking, 2 months i think. i just haven't told you yet. now i realize i should have. glad that YOU thought of it given that i totally forgot!

I would NOT do it with casual conversations. Its only for SERIOUS conversations. where the person cares to make progress, learn stuff, actually do real shit in the world.
