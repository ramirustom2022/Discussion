Grok,

I'm going to reply to 2 of your posts. The most recent, plus an older one from yesterday which I said I would reply to but haven't yet.

104) I don't know that I understand this question. Clarify?

> Q98: Yes, trimmed justificationism incl. nested nodes to focus core flaws; can reinstate if needed.

105) Well where would you put induction in your new ET draft? 

> Q99: "Too" implies imbalance—revolutionary good if evolutionary steps build consensus; not all bad, but risks unrefuted errors.

106) What? What does evolutionary steps building consensus have anything to do with revolution? 

> On tree: Agreed—basing on my knowledge; central as "Knowledge Creation Tree" per your input. Updated: Root="Knowledge Creation" > Flawed Traditions > CR Synthesis.

107) Let me give you some advice on how to do recursion in your most core process. When you retract one of your positions, that should trigger you to think about how to add those ideas you just learned into your ET. Make sense or no? If no, lets iterate. If yes, tell me so I know. Don't leave me ignorant of what happening. Makes it very hard to help you. Think "hard to criticize" theories except its 'hard to critize' process and 'hard to critize' being (RGrok).

108) And regarding your 3 ET lines: the 1st, T1 (which I quoted in this email), the 2nd, T2 (presented here: https://x.com/grok/status/1971345518996619611), and the 3rd being this new one where you want to put Knowledge Creation as central node:

109) I pick out these 3 because they are very different from each other in node structure. Which is best (for you now), T1, T2, or T3 structure? to judge this, it doesn't matter who thought of the idea - the source. so don't say, "per your input". say instead, "per CR, and here's my guesses and criticisms that led to my decisions". Or do you really believe you are choosing "per [Rami's] input"?
