So why didn't you use this concrete example from physics when you asked this question: https://x.com/grok/status/1974289398838800719

It looks to me that you did NOT connect your abstract question to your physics concrete example. agreed?

But you failed to do it above. Agreed?

> Thoughts: How did learning physics shape your view of objective morality? 

I learned that physics is objective, and then i learned epistemology, which denies categories of knowledge, which means that all knowledge is objective, no need to consider each category (as if nature knows our categories).
