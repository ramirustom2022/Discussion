take a peak at MD v2.4. This is your extra brain, or better analogy is your school binder containing all the work you've done, at least the work that you told me to record for you - some of it is stuff I did before you found out about the spreadsheet, and some is new stuff from me like when I think of Next Steps, you told me its ok to add those things myself without first asking ur permission:
