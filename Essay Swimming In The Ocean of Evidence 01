Swimming Out of the Ocean of Evidence

When a Muslim asks, “Given that Muhammad was illiterate, how could he have known X, Y, and Z? Isn’t that a miracle?”, it’s tempting to answer directly. But doing so accepts their unstated framing—that this question matters to the question of whether Islam is true. So you haven’t helped them scrutinize Islam; you’ve reinforced their mistaken idea that such “evidence” is decisive.

Many Muslims say “I believe Islam is true because of the ocean of evidence that proves…,” but swimming in that ocean does not help anyone judge Islam’s truth. Instead, it sabotages one’s efforts at truth-seeking.

Refuse to directly answer the nonsense question. The question is inconsequential because even if Muhammad’s knowledge were extraordinary, that wouldn’t imply divine origin—it would only show we don’t yet know the natural explanation. Every religion has unexplained stories; mysteries don’t imply truth. The central issue remains: “What would have to be false for Islam to collapse?” This sidesteps “miracles”. If they insist miracles matter, ask: “Why do you believe this supposed miracle matters to the question of whether Islam is true?” If their rationale convinces you, consider talking about it; otherwise, don’t waste time on nonsensical side-questions. Don’t swim in the ocean of evidence. Stay focused. Narrow the discussion to one main point, one crux, one bottleneck.

The goal is to guide the discussion toward that pivotal question. If they refuse to think or keep scattering into nonsensical side debates, you have two good options and one horrible one. You can try again to help them refocus—that’s good. You can stop engaging and explain why—that’s also good. But the horrible option is to swim with them in the ocean of evidence.

If they insist this alleged miracle matters, respond:

“But if Islam makes grand claims of perfection yet shows flaws we can all see, how does that miracle redeem the rest? Does it somehow neutralize the imperfections? Why, and in what way? Show your reasoning so we might be convinced so your side!”

That invites them to reconcile their miracle-claim with observable contradictions, rather than letting the discussion drown in a practically infinite ocean of nonsensical sub-debates.
