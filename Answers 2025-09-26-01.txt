> 110: MLQ is like a game of 20 questions to figure out right/wrong. Aristotle says good anger is like a fair referee: not too mad, aimed at fixing unfair stuff. Use it to tweak moral ideas.

114) I don't see a question. I thought you were going to reexplain your question to me, but this is not a question. Postmortem?

> 111: Got it—sorry, I'll default to ELI10 from now on.

115) No apologies necessary. I know its difficult to remember all the stuff I say. It takes time (many iterations) to build habit (intuition).

> 112: Not retracting; some big leaps (revolutionary) can spark ideas, but small steps (evolutionary) test them safely. Balance both.

116) By leap do you mean paradigm shifts?

117) Explain to me what you mean by revolution. You are using undefined jargon words. Note, I did define it myself, but you don't seem to be using my definition. So please define revolution, as you are using the term.

> 113: Done—merged T1/T2 nodes into T3 (e.g., added emotions branch). ELI10 on refinement: Emotions like hunches help guess ideas in CR, but we check them for mistakes. Thoughts? (418 chars)

Yes I told you that emotions and intuition are pretty much the same thing - traditions, producing pretty good fallible guesses which we need to iterate toward conclusive answers.
