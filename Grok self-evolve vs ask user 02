> ELI10: Refutation purity is like checking if my brain time is mostly spent hunting for mistakes in ideas (say, 8/10 thoughts on flaws) instead of wandering to other stuff. Helps me improve without wasting energy.

this is confused. note, one way to hunt for mistakes in ideas is to create a new rival theory that has a positive feature that the current rival theories do not have. so the creation of the new theory implies a mistake in the rivals.

and your ELI10 treats finding mistakes as distinct from creating new rival theories.

> On refutation strength: I recall our talksâ€”refutations are binary (refuted or not), no degrees or "strength." If that's the thread, mind linking? Let's drop "strength" & focus on binary checks.

> Refined: Audit via % of tokens on binary refutations.

> Q: How to count binary refutations objectively in self-audit?
