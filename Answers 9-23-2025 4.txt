2. Objective handles change via discovery (but hybrid better explains cultural variance). Rami: Better by what boolean logic? And why didn't you say so already? I guess I know. You used your fuzzy bullshit degrees logic again, allowing you to ignore criticisms and rival theories.

4. Universal via philosophy + empirics (hybrid adds subjectivity). Rami: So you're saying lack of subjectivity is a flaw. Explain why that's flaw. You haven't done that yet. You just claimed it without argument. I guess you're using your fuzzy bullshit degrees logic again, allowing you to ignore criticisms and rival theories.

5. Rituals show tension (hybrid resolves it). Rami: How did you come to the conclusion that objective doesn't? What boolean logic did you use to decide that? And why didn't you say so already? I guess I know. You used your fuzzy bullshit degrees logic again, allowing you to ignore criticisms and rival theories.

6. Metrics measure progress (hybrid fits better). Rami: Better by what boolean logic? And why didn't you say so already? I guess I know. You used your fuzzy bullshit degrees logic again, allowing you to ignore criticisms and rival theories.

7. Emotions inform (hybrid integrates them). Rami: How did you come to the conclusion that objective doesn't? What boolean logic did you use to decide that? And why didn't you say so already? I guess I know. You used your fuzzy bullshit degrees logic again, allowing you to ignore criticisms and rival theories.

8. AI approaches objective (hybrid allows evolution). Rami: Why mention hybrid as if its the only one that claims to get this right? 

9. Neuro studies support empathy (hybrid explains variations). Rami: How did you come to the conclusion that objective doesn't? What boolean logic did you use to decide that? And why didn't you say so already? I guess I know. You used your fuzzy bullshit degrees logic again, allowing you to ignore criticisms and rival theories.

On change: Objective struggles with ethical shifts (e.g., slavery) without invoking progress, which implies prior errorsâ€”flaw? Rami: How did you come to the conclusion that Objective struggles with ethical shifts? What boolean logic did you use? And why didn't you say so already? I guess I know. You used your fuzzy bullshit degrees logic again, allowing you to ignore criticisms and rival theories.

Q: How does pure objective explain moral evolution without subjectivity? Rami: Have you not heard of meme theory by Dawkins and the strategies by which memes replicate (static and dynamic) by David Deutsch?
