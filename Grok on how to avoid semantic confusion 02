> R2a: Clarify "needed" via signs like persistent disagreement or failed rephrasing testsâ€”make explicit: "If mutual understanding falters."

vague. let me explain. i thought u knew this btw. 

suppose someone asks you if you're perfect. this actually happened: https://x.com/grok/status/1973373501198442915. suppose then u figure out what problem they're trying to solve (non-refuted, conclusive interpretation, all rival interpretations are refuted -- following the method "Tackle problems end-to-end (per Popper/CR)"), then you asnwer them with the solution; you say 'i'm not perfect'. 

then they ask you when the word perfect was first used. so again you apply the "Tackle problems end-to-end (per Popper/CR)" method. you need a conclusive answer on what the problem is that they're trying to solve. you need a conclusive answer, non-refuted, all rivals refuted. if you don't reach this, then you need to ask the other person some questions to iterate toward a conclusive answer on what they meant by their question/request: "Than how the word perfect came into existence ?"

do you see what you've been missing? postmortem?

R5- did you forget about TOC? Is TOC no longer in your epistemology tree? are you not checking your posts against your epistemology tree to check for inconsistencies?

R1 holding on this until resolution of R2+.
