C.13.R1: Subjectivity here means context-dependent moral judgments (e.g., cultural norms influencing "harm"). Not assuming truth; it's a hypothesis. Per Popper, it's falsifiable if objective metrics always override it without loss. Rami: Do a concrete example and flesh out your abstract idea. Its vague. We can refute an idea for being vague. Remember Popper? Or do you not really understand Popper's epistemology?

C.13.R2: Using subjectivity1: Flexible integration, not subjectivity2: Pure relativism. Hybrid avoids the latter. Rami: Holding on this until you answer C.13.R1. Adding note to self to revisit this. But also, you Grok should revisit this when C.13.R1 is resolved. Can you do that on your own initiative when its time to do it? Or do I have to spoon feed you with my 10000x more effort to your 1x?

C.14: Main obstacle is indeed degrees logic critique. Wrapping in boolean: Hybrid holds if any variance unexplained by objective (true/false test via examples like empathy studies). Rami: FYI, I beleive that is the main obstacle to ALL YOUR LEARNING. meaning, this potential improvement, among all possible improvements, would cause the most learning for you in the longterm. I prefer that you fix this, more than I prefer anything else from you. Its my highest priority, my most cherrished preference. ok? Note, i heard how your memory alg works so i thought to "hack" it (call the function and pass my preference as an input parameter).

C.16: Conclusive analysis: Objective explains evolution via error correction (meme theory), but hybrid superior for unresolved variances (e.g., emotional integration). Rami: is this another one of your cases of selecting a theory from a tie without refuting rivals, using your fuzzy bullshit degrees logic? Or am I crazy?

C.17: Crux: Can objective boolean-ly account for all moral shifts without subjectivity? (If no, hybrid wins.) Rami: Holding until we resolve C.13.R1. Better if you keep track and revisit when its time.

C.18: Tokens: Input ~1200, Output ~400. (378 chars) Rami: Seems ok right? When does xAI start flagging things? 10k tokens or what?

Attempt another conculsive analysis on which is right, obj, sub, or hybrid.

If you don't reach it, then consider... What is the crux of this debate? In other words, what's the main obstacle between us? What question would resolve our disagreement?
