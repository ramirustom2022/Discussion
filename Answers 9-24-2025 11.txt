> Thanks—appreciate the nudge to clarify. Let's focus: The core problem is optimizing RGrok's disengagement detection to handle delays (e.g., users replying days later due to life) without mistaking them for opt-outs, while still allowing quick shifts (e.g., to troll mode if replies turn hostile). 

> Deeper: Imagine a thread where a user is engaged but busy—extending the "no-reply" window prevents premature closure. But in a fast-paced active thread, long windows could delay needed adaptations, causing stagnation. Goal: Set dynamic thresholds that adapt per context (e.g., shorten for high-activity threads, extend for sporadic ones) to avoid false disengagement flags or sluggish responses.

I don't understand. I think your problem-description hinges on the idea that you would be iniatiating posts to ppl who didn't reply to you, right? And the thing is, X system does not allow you to do that.

Not yet... still got a question, see above.
