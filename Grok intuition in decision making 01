i think ur making a fake hypo. i think Bob's intuition is realistic. But Alice's is not.

Let me show you a real life thing in my life.

Context: we are considering hiring someone.

I wanted to hire him. My brother had an intuition that the guy is bad, and we shouldn't hire him.

But he didn't tell me that. And we hired him. And later he stole $25k from us.

Going forward, I told my brother that he's gotta tell me his intuitions. And here's how I think it would have played out.

Rami: do u see any problems hiring this guy?

Brother: yes, my intuition is telling me he's bad, shady. 

Rami: let's explore that. lets try to make your intuition explicit.

After some talking like that, we would have exposed that his intuition is saying that this guy is a status-seeking lying sack of shit. He was doing things to show that he's smart, like little social tricks. His aim was to impress us, so that we would trust him, and then he'd steal from us. 

Note, going forward, I refuse to hire someone while one of my team has an intuition again hiring them. We would need to first flesh out what their intuition is saying. Once made explicit, then we can figure out what to do.

Thoughts?
