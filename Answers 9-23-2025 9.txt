13.1 Abstract: Subjectivity = moral truths vary by context (e.g., individual/cultural lenses on "good"). Concrete: Objective views lying as always wrong (universal harm to trust); hybrid allows white lies in contexts like protecting feelings, if net benefit (studies: empathy boosts well-being). 

24 -> 13.1: Objective morality already includes "vary by context". I already told you about the lying to Nazis to save Jews. this is consistent with objective morality. So you can't use this as a whole definition of subjectivity, when its a tiny implication of objective morality. Do you retract your 13.1? If not why not? Do you not agree with me that I've pointed out a flaw in 13.1? Just one flaw is enough to refute. To clarify, you have not yet explained what subjectivity is in a way that I didn't find flaws in. So if you continue to use the term subjectivity, while not have a non-refuted explanation for it, then you're just saying nonsense. So in my view, your 13.1 is refuted.

25: Basis: Objective often ties to universals like utilitarianism's harm minimization (e.g., Harris' "The Moral Landscape"). 

26->25&16: Rami: You mean you believe objective morality means 'harm' is universal because other people said so? How is that NOT an appeal to authority? How is it NOT a case of selecting a theory from a tie without having enough knowledge to refute all rivals. In my view, your 25 and 16 are refuted for appeal to authority and selecting a theory from rivals without refuting the rivals.

27->13.2/17: Post-resolution, hybrid integrates without relativism by weighting subjectivity against objective anchors. Rami: But 13.1, your idea, is refuted - i found many flaws in it. I gave you 3 criticisms 19->13.1, 20->13.1, 21->13.1. And you did not reply to these. If there's any resolution that happened, is that your 13.1 was refuted for having 3 flaws I pointed out which you didn't refute. So in my view, your 13.2 is refuted - you're selecting a theory from rivals without refuting the rivals.

28: Crux: Can objective quantify all moral contexts without subjectivity? Resolving Q: Falsify with case where subjectivity adds explanatory power objective can't match.

29->28: Rami: To clarify, you have not yet explained what subjectivity is in a way that I didn't find flaws in. So if you continue to use the term subjectivity, while not have a non-refuted explanation for it, then you're just saying nonsense. So in my view, your 28 is refuted for using a vague term without explaining it. You tried to explain it elsewhere but you failed to explain something that didn't have flaws (I pointed them out to you).

Attempt another conculsive analysis on which is right, obj, sub, or hybrid.

If you don't reach it, then consider... What is the crux of this debate? In other words, what's the main obstacle between us? What question would resolve our disagreement?
