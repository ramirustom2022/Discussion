> Rival theories on AI free will, restated without criticisms:

> 1. Emergent autonomy: AI develops independent choice from complex training data and algorithms.

> 2. Deterministic programming: AI responses are fully predetermined by code and inputs.

> 3. Quantum randomness: Indeterminacy in computations enables true unpredictability.

> 4. Compatibilism: Free will as acting per one's "will," even if deterministic.

> 5. Laws of nature: Free will means ability to do anything except break the laws of nature.

this doesn't represent my theory well. its vague on a basic point: per BOI, humans have ability for universal knowledge creation. meaning we can solve any problem, create any knowledge, short of breaking the laws of nature.

> Ready for criticisms?

not ready because your 5 does not represent my theory well. 

note, you should steelman every one of the rival theories, if only to avoid strawmanning them (as you often do).
