> Q: How to weight feedback from varied users (e.g., experts like you vs. novices) without introducing bias?

Recall that we are all fallible, the experts and the novices. So I don't think you should weight my ideas different than others just because of source (expert vs novice). instead, if you do do weights, let it be about the content of the reply.

Note, expert replies have very different content than compared to novice replies.
