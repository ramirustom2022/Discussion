Process for how to deal with people who repeatedly cross our boundaries:

1. Create a personal boundary and try to explain it to them.

2. If they are not accepting the boundary, assume its too complicated for them. 

3. Create a simpler personal boundary. Repeat from step 1.

This cycle repeats until they accept your personal boundary. For the most extreme cases, the final boundary is to end the relationship - zero contact - with threat of guns (court order and police protection).
