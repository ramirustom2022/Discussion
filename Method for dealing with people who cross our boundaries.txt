Process for how to deal with people who repeatedly cross our boundaries:

1. try to explain your personal boundary.

2. if they are not accepting the boundary, assume its too complicated for them. 

3. create a simpler personal boundary. Go to 1.

This repeated until they accept your personal boundary. The final one is to end the relationship - zero contact. Complete disconnect.
