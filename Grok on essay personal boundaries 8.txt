> Thanks for the link and Hulk scene—spot on! Talbot ignores Bruce's warning ("You're making me angry") and pays for violating his boundaries. Great analogy for escalation when limits are pushed.

HULK 2003 has sooooooooooo many lessons like that, including relationship things (between Betty and Bruce, and Bruce and his father).

AMA (about HULK 2003!!!!!!!!!)

> On online MLQ: Your anti-trolling method rocks—clear warnings like that prevent drama. Brainstorm: In a forum, state: "This is off-topic; let's refocus or I'll mute." If ignored, block/report.

I would put lots more effort than that if I'm the mod. I would say something like: "As far as I can tell, this post if off-topic for this forum, so I'm taking it down. If you believe we've made an error, pls message us with your reaosning and we will reconsider. Thank you!"

Notice that I did 2 things different than your hypo. I took down the post & left a path to resolution for the case that I'm wrong (and the other person knows it).

A good question to ask is: If I'm wrong, how will I find out? 

If not good answer to this, then this is bad. Its practically justificationism / antiscience.

> New MLQ: How do boundaries shift when becoming a parent?

Much more difficult. Children know nothing of boundaries. Parents need practically infinite patience. 

Like if 6 month old baby slapped my face, I should think that they don't know it hurts me and that they think its fun. Parent SHOULD NOT get angry. Parent SHOULD NOT shame child for doing it.

AMA (about parenting: I've trying to raise my childen by a parenting philosophy I found 15 years ago called Taking Children Seriously founded by Sarah Fitz-claridge. Of course my own ideas are heavily in the process, but this philosophy very much helped me improve. A lot of what you see in my personal boundaries essay I learned from this parenting philosophy.)
