> Got it—your essay shows practical boundaries tailored to your flow, like preferring emails over calls for non-urgent employee matters (reserving calls for true urgency), and family rules allowing kid interruptions except during locked-door work/livestreams. Hundreds of these micro-boundaries make sense for your adaptive style.
> What’s one family example that’s evolved recently? 

not recent but most important. my daughters know if they want to talk with me about something important, to make sure you do it in a way that gives me the best chance to reply in kind. like a meeting, where i can put full attention on the issue. don't talk to me in passing. its not fair to me to expect me to do well like that. i use an analogy. its like a student asking a teacher how to do a math problem while skydiving. Imagine the teacher saying "WHAT? I DIDN'T HEAR YOU!" And the student says "YEP I THOUGHT SO TOO!".
