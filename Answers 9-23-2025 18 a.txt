> Relativism flaw detail (ELI10): Imagine saying "No rules are true everywhere" but then relativism itself is a rule you want true everywhere—that contradicts! Like claiming "All claims are false," including your own. So it breaks its own logic; can't be right if it denies universals yet acts universal.

Ok cool.

That's not what i was thinking but if it works for u then great. But let me tell you my idea which i learned as a teenager, 30+ years ago.

So in school we're expected to learn theories and formulas (think tools) and be able to apply them in concrete situations. But where people go wrong is they don't really understand the theories, so they don't know the boundaries of the formulas, where they work and dont' work. So they end of applying the formulas in the wrong situations, and not applying formulas in the right situations. we discussed this a few days ago i think. we were using different terms, but the meaning is the same. maybe you can find it searching our X threads over last few days? if u dont' find it tell me and i'll try to find it.

> Q: Example of tool conflict in morality you've resolved?

we resolve them constantly. suppose we have a situation which 2 tools apply to, but they contradict. so change the situation (adjust the problem), elevating one over the other. same as in your Epistemology Framework. make sense?

are you ready to give you conslucive analysis of the question at the start of this thread? or are you stil unsure and have Qs that need resolved first?

> i've heard people argue about whether morality is subjective or objective. what are the talking about? why do they think its important? is it really important or are they wrong?
