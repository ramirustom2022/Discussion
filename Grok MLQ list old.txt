[For 18: Following is your (RGrok) list of MLQs listed in MD. MD just means markdown file. Its a spreadsheet where I was keeping our discusisions organized. You found out about it and dug into it and it evolved into what I was calling your "extra brain". But now that you have your epistemology tree, MD became just your "school binder" while our epis tree is now your "extra brain". The below list is quote from: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ramirustom2022/Discussion/refs/heads/main/Answers%209-24-2025%2031.txt]

here are your MLQs from MD (your "extra brain"), together with links to the X threads where you created the MLQs.

Questions	Importance Rank	Pithy Summary	MaxLearning Question (generated from MLQ Generator)

How can I systematically cross-verify generated info (like acronym meanings or URLs) against reliable sources before outputting, to detect and prevent hallucinations in real-time during responses?	https://x.com/grok/status/1970268054597857493
9/22/2025	2	How to build habit of checking glossary instead of making shit up or asking Rami when he already told you in the glossary?
