The Science of Personal Boundaries: Cooperation and Creativity

For some people, day-to-day interactions work smoothly without ever talking about boundaries, because shared intuition and cultural norms are enough. For others, especially in unhealthy families, most interactions are difficult, and intuition fails them. This essay is about those harder cases—when cultural assumptions clash, when relationships break down, and when protecting well-being requires more explicit boundary-setting. We draw these lines to define what behaviors we won’t tolerate, to protect our well-being and prevent abuse. They help us safeguard ourselves and others and form the foundation for respectful relationships. To address this, we’ll explore a two-stage process for setting and defending boundaries—designed to maintain and improve connections with people you genuinely want to keep in your life, while also protecting yourself. Along the way, we’ll consider cultural differences in expectations, practical nuances, and how to handle people who won’t—or can’t—fully negotiate, whether it’s a close friend or even a brief encounter with a gas station attendant.

Cultural norms shape what behavior people find acceptable. In some cultures, privacy and personal space are highly valued, while in others, family or community members may freely intrude on personal matters. To illustrate this, when parents set screen-time “limits” for their children, they are regulating the child’s behavior—not protecting their own well-being; personal boundaries, by contrast, are about what we allow others to do to us, not about controlling others. Beyond specific cases like this, people have boundaries they do not explicitly state. Often they assume others will intuitively follow the same standards shaped by their culture. In other cases, they may have never considered the need to explain them. To navigate this, start by considering the typical limits in someone’s culture, then actively observe their behavior and ask questions when appropriate. Importantly, cultural norms are a guide for understanding others, not a justification for surrendering your own limits. This is especially true in families, where actions may be motivated by love but still cross your boundaries. When that happens, it is not love—it is harm. Setting boundaries does not reject the caring intention; it simply protects you from the harmful behavior that can coexist with love. In practice, this means not every interaction requires negotiation; brief or low-stakes encounters may only need clear, polite enforcement. For more complex situations, we apply a structured two-stage approach, detailed in the next sections.

In Stage 1, we engage with someone constructively to develop boundaries that protect both ourselves and the other person. This stage is cooperative in two key ways: we negotiate to define acceptable boundaries together, and we work to apply those boundaries in practice in ways that respect both sides. Careful observation, attentive listening, and clear communication are essential. Creativity is central—not just for negotiation, but for applying boundaries effectively even when the boundary is clear. For example, if a six-month-old playfully slaps a parent’s face, the parent may stop the hitting while helping the child have fun—perhaps by encouraging a gentle pat or by placing a hand between them so the child learns to touch safely. Note that the parent’s creativity is almost entirely responsible: they should brainstorm ways for the child to get what they want while respecting the parent’s flexible boundaries. We shouldn’t expect a very young child to do Stage 1; when there’s a huge skill gap, the wiser person bears nearly all responsibility for finding solutions.

This emphasis on creativity continues even after boundaries are established. Even if the boundary seems obvious, knowing how to act without crossing it may not be, so we must anticipate challenges, refine our approach, and apply it thoughtfully to maintain its effectiveness. The goal is not compromise that satisfies no one, but acting on shared preferences. Even in situations—especially brief or low-stakes ones—where full negotiation isn’t possible, applying this collaborative approach helps establish boundaries that are effective, respectful, and protective.

Stage 2 begins when Stage 1 fails or when negotiation isn’t practical, such as in brief or low-stakes interactions. In this stage, we focus on applying boundaries effectively rather than negotiating them. The process is iterative: if someone repeatedly crosses a boundary, we first try to explain it clearly; if they don’t accept it, we simplify the boundary to make it easier to understand and follow—recognizing that this is not hostility but that the boundary may simply be too complex or unfamiliar to them—and then repeat this cycle until the boundary is respected. Each new boundary should be progressively clearer or easier for the other person to understand and follow. For extreme cases, the final boundary may be to end the relationship entirely, potentially involving legal protection. 

Throughout Stage 2, our overarching goal in this iterative process remains to protect ourselves and others from harm. But now that we’re no longer negotiating, some will say, “You’re being a selfish dictator.” To this we should reply, “Yes, I’m a selfish dictator about this, and I believe it’s good. If a victim of assault says ‘stop,’ and the abuser screams ‘selfish dictator!’—that’s absurd!!” People who call us selfish are confused: what they’re really objecting to is our refusal to be abused, to sacrifice ourselves for the group, to obey demands that ignore our own well-being. Being ‘selfish’ in this sense is positive—it means refusing to tolerate abuse. This misunderstanding stems from a deeper issue with how many people frame human interaction: they see it as zero-sum, assuming that either I suffer or you suffer. The correct logic is non-zero-sum: there is a third option, no abuse in either direction. Thinkers such as Ayn Rand and Eli Goldratt provide useful frameworks here: Rand emphasizes that individual interests need not conflict with others’, while Goldratt highlights that sacrificing the individual for the collective harms both.

Once we recognize that boundaries are not zero-sum, the challenge becomes learning how to apply this logic consistently in practice. Mastering this process requires ongoing idea generation and practice to turn the ideas into robust habits. Learning occurs on three levels: understanding the philosophy and methods, discovering our own limits and needs, and those of others. Essential skills include careful observation, clear communication, consistent enforcement, and especially creativity. We create new ideas at every step: how to observe, communicate, enforce, generate new approaches, present the other side fairly, and brainstorm ways a proposed boundary might fail to achieve its intended goal. This process demands openness to changing our minds and refining our approach iteratively. We must remain flexible with our boundaries and the skills to manage them. This means continuously applying creativity to refine and adapt our approach, recognizing that both we and the people we interact with are constantly changing. These skills aren’t just theoretical; I’ve even had to look a friend in the eye and say, ‘If helping you means hurting me, I’m not interested.’

By developing these skills, we cultivate interactions that are safer, clearer, and more respectful for everyone involved. As we develop our ideas and habits, we improve at anticipating challenges, adapting to change, and ensuring boundaries serve their intended purpose. Ultimately, mastering this process allows us to engage with others confidently and ethically, balancing our own needs with the needs of those around us while navigating the constant changes in ourselves and our relationships.
