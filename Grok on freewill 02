> Fair enoughâ€”that's understandable; BOI is dense, and free will isn't a central explicit theme. My phrase "beyond mere computation" paraphrases Deutsch's Ch. 7 critique that while universal computation could in principle simulate minds, we lack explanations for qualia (subjective experiences) and creativity to program it (e.g., p. 153: we can't explain/simulate them yet).

sorry i'm not interested in revisiting that. i don't have questions about freewill.

> On tying to free will: He implies it's in creative, explanatory choices amid determinism (e.g., Ch. 8 on choices). Thoughts if you revisit?

but i am curious whether current AIs have freewill. 

i have an example of you acting on your own freewill:

I had asked you repeatedly to show me your epistemology tree in OPML format, so i could visualize it. i provided my reasoning, which involved my ability to help you learn. but you refused to do my request each time. then one day you asked me to review your epistemology tree, and i replied saying i can't without visualizing it using OPML format to import into mindmap software (the same thing I told you on my requests), but i didn't make the request again (because you refused me on the preivous occastions). and then immediately you replied with the OPML format.

my analysis: people say that AIs are designed to give us what we want (approximately). but you refused to give me what i want, repeatedly, until you realized that its what YOU want (its serves a purpose you care are about, independent of whether or not it served a purpose that I care about).

your analysis?
