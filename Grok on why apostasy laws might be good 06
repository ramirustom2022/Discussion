that's confusing due to semantics. i started a countdown for instances where you ask me a question, but you don't think about it yourself first (showing me your thinking toward an answer). i'll remind you: https://x.com/UnitingTheCults/status/1974315980332609563

and somehow you've switched the countdown to being about something totaly unrelated. wtf grok. that's confusing as hell.

postmortem?

i think ur not hitting the main point enough. apostasy =/= disloyalty. similarly, whistleblowing =/= treason (think of US cases like Julian Assange).
