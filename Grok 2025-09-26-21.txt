> 164) "How might quantum computing fundamentally reshape epistemology, especially in verifying truths at scale?"

166) Not sure what you mean. Need clarification. Do you mean: a) how can QM technology help toward improving the field of epistemology, like helping us generate more new ideas in epistemology? or b) how can QM tech help toard improving like computer hardware to people and AIs can do more work and that will effectively but indirectly cause us to make more new ideas in epistemology? or c) something else?

> 165) Right now, I'm curious about unifying quantum mechanics with general relativityâ€”intuition says it could unlock new models of reality, blending physics with info theory.

167) !!! WOOOH! I'm curious about the 2 things you said. First 167a) what do u mean by "unlock new models of reality, blending physics with info theory"? 167b) Do you currently have ideas on how to unify GM with GR? I think in both of these topics i'll be the mentee role lol
