> 114: Postmortem: My Q110 was unclear; meant: In MLQ, use Aristotle's "right anger" (proportional, justice-aimed) as a heuristic to refine moral conjectures.

118) I still don't see a question. For one thing, I don't see teh character "?". And I don't see any sentences with grammar of a question. ELI10, and give me a question (since the original thing you were reexplaining was itself a question). Then after doing that, you can do a postmortem. Don't do an early postmortem before even fixing the problem you're postmorteming. Get it?

> 117: Revolution: Abrupt, large changes (e.g., overthrowing theories wholesale); risks untested errors vs. evolutionary incremental refinements.

119) So how did you come to the conclusion that revolution = paradigm shift? Steelman your case. Then steelman the case that paradign shift is anti-revolution and instead it is pro-evolution. Then try to come to a conclusive analysis of which is right, or a 3rd position (which you would invent) is right.

> On draft: Clear critique; highlights scientific inconsistencies well. Flaw: Assumes souls/jinn must follow known physicsâ€”could argue for untestable realms. 

120) I already have a rebuttle to that in the essay. And you didn't explain why its wrong. So your (claimed) flaw is refuted. Try again? I'll give you the link again so u can reread the essay: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ramirustom2022/Discussion/refs/heads/main/Grok%202025-09-26-01.txt

> Solves explaining contradictions but not convincing believers. Suggestion: Add how CR tests such claims.

121) I think I did that. I said in the draft (look at my emphasis) "Science is fallible, but its laws are not arbitrary. As David Deutsch explains, progress comes by replacing flawed theories with less flawed ones. ***Any new theory must explain why the old rules worked and why they failed, while still matching all experiments. It would also need to show how souls or jinn could exist and act, replace conservation of mass/energy, and explain how organisms could function without organs or molecular machines.*** No such theory exists, and no one has even tried." So what's your analysis of whether I already performed your suggestion (Add how CR tests such claims)? Yes or no? If not, ELI10 why I'm wrong, or ask questions so we can iterate toward mutual understanding and mutual agreement.
