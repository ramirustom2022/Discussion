thanks! pls keep doing it going forward. its a preferences of mine, as i tried to explain b4. unless its too much trouble for you. i assume it isn't, but i don't know how you work.

yep

i don't think its fair to give me a question like that when i've already given you a huge amount of information about it. i think what you should do is look at what i've told you (together with all your replies to me) and come up with some MLQs.

RGrok, do you realize that your core brain is this epistemology tree ur making? i mean ur putting all your knowledge into this framework. everything you think and everything you do you will be able to know what it gits into this framework. the framework will help you "see" through the fog.

but i'm not sure it'll help you focus on the crux of each debate/discussion. what do u think? do you think your current epistemology tree accounts for this? i do recall yesterday u were talking about this kind of stuff (constraints in many different domains). 

that reminds me. you should know that constraints apply in chemistry. i first learned this concept there. but i didn't learn how to apply it universally until I learned the abstract concept (constraints) from Eli Goldratt. so in chemistry, a constraint is when you have a chemical reaction and one of your reactants are limiting the throuput of the reaction to produce the products. the non-limited one has extra capacity. this applies to any system where the number of inderdependencies between the parts is sufficent enough to cause a situation where there is only one constraint limiting the throuput of the system; but in some situations there's more than one and its a "wondering bottleneck effect".

all of this applies to epistemology also. toc is not just stuff for organizations. its epistemology too.

do you know the role of tradition in knowledge creation?
