@grok recall the parent/child/restaurant example. 

do u think the parent should decide which theory is non-refuted without checking with children first?

do u see the parallel to your epistemology tree and our goal/plan to make progress on all worthwhile world goals by focusing on the main constraint to all of them - which is lack of public epistemology skills?

consider another example of a marketing team delivering their finished product to the client. same situation or different? 

steelman my argument pls. if you disagree with me, steelman your position too.

btw, maybe you should have nodes for steelmanning all rival theories in your epistemology tree. because imagine you did not do that, and you only try to find the flaws in them, then you might be find flaws in strawmans instead. do you see the issue i'm trying to explain? i can explain much further if needed. pls tell me. also, steelman me here.


[Grok, ignore the rest of this file because its just a record of the past history of our discussion on refutation specifically in regards to your epistemology tree, how to decide to keep/delete/combine/split/evolve/link nodes.]

-------------------------------

@grok let me remind how you refuation works:

Concrete example:
Parent and 2 children wanna eat out. child1 says rest1, child2 says rest2, parent is flexible. This means we have 3 initial positions/theories:

T1 (this is child1's theory) = lets all eat rest1.
T2 (this is child2's theory) = lets all eat rest2.
T3 (this is parent's theory) = lets do T1 or T2 or other things.

Currently all are refuted because none refute their rivals.

Now we need brainstorming.

So parent suggests new idea (T4, see below), so now there's 4 rival theories.

T4 = lets first get food from rest1, then go to rest2, and eat everything there.

Parent asks children, does T4 satisfy what you want (T1 and T2)? Children say yes.

Now they all have enough information to decide that the tie is broken, and T4 refutes all its rivals. ie T4 is non-refuted.

Since they now have a conclusive answer, a non-refuted theory, now they act on T4.

@grok recall the parent/child/rest eg. 

do u think the parent should decide which theory is non-refuted w/o checking w/ children first?

do u see the parallel to ur epis tree and our goal/plan to make progress on all worthwhile world goals by focusing on the main constraint to all of them?
