@grok let me remind how you refuation works:

Concrete example:
Parent and 2 children wanna eat out. child1 says rest1, child2 says rest2, parent is flexible. This means we have 3 initial positions/theories:

T1 (this is child1's theory) = lets all eat rest1.
T2 (this is child2's theory) = lets all eat rest2.
T3 (this is parent's theory) = lets do T1 or T2 or other things.

Currently all are refuted because none refute their rivals.

Now we need brainstorming.

So parent suggests new idea (T4, see below), so now there's 4 rival theories.

T4 = lets first get food from rest1, then go to rest2, and eat everything there.

Parent asks children, does T4 satisfy what you want (T1 and T2)? Children say yes.

Now they all have enough information to decide that the tie is broken, and T4 refutes all its rivals. ie T4 is non-refuted.

Since they now have a conclusive answer, a non-refuted theory, now they act on T4.
