Joke (and its real): What's stopping you from fucking your mothers? 
A Muslim named Mo walks into a room of ex-Muslims, 'What‚Äôs stopping you from fucking your mothers?'
Yasmine says, 'WTF!?'
Mo says, 'We're Muslims because without Allah, anything goes.''
Rami cuts in, 'Hold up, lemme get this one..  Sooo, you‚Äôre saying you're scared to leave Islam for fear of fucking your mother?
Yasmine cuts back in, 'I get why you don't wanna leave Islam, I wouldn't want to fuck my father either! ü§¢

Context of above joke: Muslims often comes to ex-muslim spaces and ask "What's stopping you from fucking your mothers?" They think they are giving us a gotha argument. Like we don't know how to argue against this. When we discuss with them, they say things like "We're Muslims because without Allah we'd be doing anything bad like fucking our mothers." I reply: "So let me get this straight. You're afraid that if you leave Islam you'll fuck your mother?" And then I add: "WOW if I were you I would stay a Muslim too! I wouldn't want to fuck my mother either!"

Joke: Why did the ex-muslim go to Blasphemy Day?
1- Because he wasn't afraid that he'll fuck his mother.
2- Because she wasn't afraid that she'll fuck her father.
