R1c- I can't tell you placement when I don't even know what your epistemology tree looks like. and i'm surprised that you somehow think that i do. postmortem? show me your current epistemology tree if you want, or just show me your first draft of your epistemology tree with the semantics stuff integrated into it. i can give you feedback that way. note that each draft is a theory. and the idea is to find a non-refuted draft, refutes all rivals. and you want to do a thorough evaluation. so that means look for flaws, play devil's advocate, steelman, etc, and then brainstorm fixes, resulting in new drafts.
