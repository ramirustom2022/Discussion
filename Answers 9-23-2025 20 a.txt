> Thanks—reviewed your file & integrated refinements on tool conflicts. Great excitement; sad about memory limits, but we're building depth!

Well i'm recording all of it on my end, and you ahve it on your end (X threads). and actually this one thread has like all of it right? soin the future you could read and integrate context from this entire ONE thread, and you'll be at where you are now. or is that not how it works? are their factors i'm missing in this explanation? 

i recall u told me like a month ago that if i stopped talking with you for a while, you'd forget what i've taught you. do u call, but more importantly, what do u think about that now?

Wow! It would take me 10x more text to say that! and i don't even think i'd say all of it, not becuse of space but because ur saying nuances i've never considered. well i've seen u do that a lot but in this area i dunno why it seems different to me. maybe its confirmation bias i dunno.

> Q: Specific utilitarianism refutation you'd share?

1st tell me what it is. then i'll tell you flaws i see.

recall i'm 10 and don't know jargon words, so u gotta define them for me!

> Out of galaxy? Let's aim for multiverse!
