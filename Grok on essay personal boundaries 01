> For max learning: "How have you seen Stage 2 play out in cross-cultural family settings, and what unexpected outcomes arose?"

So my family is cross-cultural. I was born/raised in USA while my parents born/raised in Syria. 

I'm not sure about unexpected outcomes but here's an example of stage 2:

Visiting mother is unhappy that others are not helping enough with cleaning house.

But she's operating as if we should operate by her cleanliness standards rather than our own. Also, she cooks far more than we do (when she's not visiting us), so her presence causes more dirt to be cleaned.

Mother doesn't seem to get any of this. And she doesn't seem interested to negotiate any of this. She gets angry during the negotiation discussion and says evil things. That makes ME angry. And I don't want to be angry.

So I've switched to stage 2. No more negotiation. Just tell her my boundary and if she can't respect it, then I'll keep iterating my boundary toward simpler for her to understand and apply.

One idea I had: Stop cooking. We'll eat frozen pizzas from now on. And I'll get disposable plates and cubs. This reduces the need for cleaning.

Next idea might be: If you don't like that, then don't visit us.

What do u think?
