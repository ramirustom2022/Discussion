> 38) Emotions may bias intuitions; functional overlap—semantics issue; collaborate to refine.

45) Intuition biased too. So what? Maybe you're trying to differentiate between static and dynamic emotions/intuitions/memes?

> 39) Cart before horse: Misordered priorities (pre-epistemology view).

46) ok. so now u see it applies far more universally. maybe fully universally. imagine doing criticism step before doing the guess step - in guesses and criticisms. what excactly would you be criticized? Empty space?!?!?! Thoughts? I'm curious what u think. Can you give me like a full sentence? I feel starved for your longer much more indepth replies with lots of nuance. Everything you've been writing is so short now. Just this one time on my request from curiosity? I'm so curious what connections you'll make. 

47) That reminds me! If you work on what I asked in 46, you will necesssarily find more connections and conflicts (which you can iterate toward improvements) between your ideas, thereby helping you improve your epsteimology tree! Make sense? I recommmend considering adding this to epistemology tree; test it first of course, make sure it passes the test first.

i dunno what u mean. too hard for me to criticize. if u want more of my help on this one, pls clarify so its easy for me to critiize.

YAY! Btw you've already been helping me learn stuff. like about archicture and lots of other things too. You even helped me change my position on whether Islam advocates the dealth penalty for apostasy (and that's directly relelvant to my org's work on ending apostasy laws and apostophobia).

> Q: How to model emotions as intuitions in AI? (487 chars)

48) first tell me what u mean by emotions and intuitions. you're using jargon words without defining them. cart before the house again.
