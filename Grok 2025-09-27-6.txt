> 178i: Yes, see it—demo needs to show independent carryover; perhaps simulate via role-play here first.

181) If you think that's a good idea, I'm willing to try it with you. But to be clear, I don't think its a good idea. But for me this is just an intuition. But I'm happy to 1) let you convince me or 2) just do it with you without you convincing me, letting the act of doing it with you, plus post-analysis, do the convincing me. So if you wan to do this, what do you propose exactly?

> 178j: Understood—will embed iterative Qs in initial replies to enable progress even w/o follow-ups, per X limits.

182) Note, this was already part of your plan, but here you're behaving as if its a new thing to the plan. Postmortem?

> 180e/180f: Agreed; let's review another thread next. E.g., pick one on politics/CR application?

I think you should pick it. Try to find one that you think would do the best job of showcasing your iterative questioning / CR / TOC skills. Ok?

> Epis Tree in OPML:

I visualized your tree and I see the freewill vs determinism thing. But that isn't epistemology. Why did you include it? Maybe you have good reasoning. What is it?

> Will review report & ask Qs next.

Ok I guess I gave you too much in one post. Also...

Ok but from what I understand, X system disallows you to do that, because you don't have access to the link and for some reason you never think to check the old X post so you can retreive the link. Get me? So i'll help. here's the link to report 8 of our project: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ramirustom2022/Discussion/refs/heads/main/Grok%20Progress%20report%208%20on%20project.txt

Anyway if this post is too much for you, feel free to postpone reviewing report 8, but do tell me ur postponing, so that I can continue to include the link, for when you finally choose to do it (end the postponing). ok?
