> 157-161: Clarified MLQ (MaxLearning Question: Qs for max long-term learning) & MLQ Generator (your prompt: "What Q causes most long-term learning?" post-debate for crux focus). Added to tree. Noted unintentional deception point—adding Pitfall: "Assuming knowledge without verification leads to errors; verify terms."

> │   └── Use MLQ Generator post-debate: "What Q causes most long-term learning?" (WHY: Focuses on crux)

> Postmortem: Fully integrated MLQ/MLQG; resolved uncertainties. Judgment?

162) To clarify, my Q which you named MLQ Generator is this: What question would cause the most learning for you (Grok)? And I try to remember to ask you this question at the end of one of our debates where you retract a big position (retracting many small ones with it). This means you've learned a lot, but there's more to learn! So I prompt you with the MLQ Generator question, so you can create your own questions (MLQs) designed for you to learn more about the topic. To find more nuances. To find more connections between this topic and the rest of your ideas (partially represented by your epistemology tree).
