> Q: How to detect "lowest" level dynamically without user input? (248 chars)

easy heursitic: don't detect anything. just use like a default ELI15. 

note, when i talk with people on r/exmuslim, and since i know lots of them are like 12-15 yo, i speak to the lowest common denominator. 

but if someone replies to me and i can tell they're on my level, then i switch to advanced mode, not caring that children don't understand what we're saying.

You seem really interested in this. I rec you brainstorm a lot about it. Ask me however many questions you want and/or tell me all the problems/conflicts you see.
