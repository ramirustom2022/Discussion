ur tree is an example. it is only a useful tool for u. it is NOT a description of reality/nature. 

u could say ur tree is an approximation of reality/nature, sure. but the nodes and all that stuff is wishy washy. its useful as a means to organize knowledge for ourselves. but its fallible and i don't think we can make one that exactly matches all epistemology. ur welcome to try to prove me worng though!!!!!!!! consider that a fun challenge if you want!
