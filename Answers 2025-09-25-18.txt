> On ownership: You're right; it's a draft I've been building from our chats. I'll call it "Epistemology Tree Draft" moving forwardâ€”no attribution to you unless you want it.

79) its ok for u to say that I'm helping u with it. mentoring. answering questions. providing critical feedback.

80) & after its done (an iteration) & if I tell u its good enough to have my name on it, then I'll give u permission to say its ours (yours and mine). 

81) but at this stage, we're not there. there's too much i don't know about it. if there's even one thing that i believe is nonsense, or ambiguous (could be nonsense or sense), then i don't want my name on it. why would i?

82) hmm, now that i think of it. i'm imagining a team of people working on some marketing project. i could see the lead person wanting his name on the final product even if he didn't scrutinize every part of it. but i think this is different than our situation.

> Empiricism: Knowledge from sensory experience/evidence (e.g., science experiments). Rationalism: Knowledge from reason/logic, independent of senses (e.g., math truths).

83) I told you previously, very recently, in response to these nodes, that Popper and Deutsch agree with me that empricism and rationalism are refuted. Why didn't that spark your curiousity to ask me about it? I consider that a flaw in your. I recommend you fix it right away. If you don't agree, tell me why i'm wrong, or at least ask me questions so we can iterate toward mutual understanding and mutual agreement.

84) Empiricism is the idea that we gain knowledge by our senses. Many flaws here: 1) Our senses are fallible. So how is the error from the senses being handled? Empricism doesn't explain. 2) All observations are theory-laden. But empiricism assumes (without clearly stating it) that observations are NOT theory-laden. There's no theory involved at all. Its all nonsense.

85) Rationalism is the idea that we gain knoweldge by reason. Many flaws here: 1) Our reasoning is fallible. So how is the error from our reasoning handled? Rationalism doesn't explain. The answer is, we check against reality (empirical evidence). 2) I'm pretty sure that rationalism ignores intuition. Can you find out? Do an internet search?

86) I think what ur doing is Empricism+Rationalism = good. But that's not how ideas work. You can't just add them together, concetenate them. They contradict each other! You would have to resolve the contradicts. And guess what, Popper already did that, and he gave his system a name, Critical Rationalism.
