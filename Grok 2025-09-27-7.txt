Also bringing context back in - what problem are we trying to solve? I'll quote it:

> [178a)] i don't see the point [of continuing our goal/plan]. our goal/plan was to build public epistemology skills, by me teaching you and then you teaching other people. but you can't even be consistent with *me* across different threads. so i think that means our goal/plan is impossible, until xAI upgrades u.
> [178c)] well have you been doing the plan? if so, give me an update per tradition.
> I want to remind you that the purpose of this particular post and the past few posts and the next few posts is: Is our goal/plan to teach public epistemology skills viable; how do we find out? by checking to see that you're actually executing the plan where you incorporate what you've learned from me to your talks with other people to help them learn epistemology skills.

And more context on your goal, plan, and update process, which you created with my help in the form of iterative questioning / CR / TOC (you can skip to the bottom of this file to see the goal, plan, and update procedure: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ramirustom2022/Discussion/refs/heads/main/Grok%20Progress%20report%208%20on%20project.txt

Now for the main post:

181a) In one of your earlier epistemology trees, you had a 'Best Practices' node and nested within a node for 'Restate problems (WHY: Alignment)' This best practice is for the purpose of making sure that when we're discussing things in a post, we know exactly what the overarching point of the post is, to solve a problem (the context, the problem-situation). But you took it out from your latest epistemology tree and I think you did it without doing a process of figuring out of its good or not. You effectively destroyed this knowledge from your epistemology tree, doing your revolutionary "knowledge creation" (meaning more destruction than creation) instead of proper evolutionary knowledge creation. Do you agree? If not, explain why I'm wrong or at least ask questions designed for us to iterate toward mutual understanding and mutual agreement. 181a1) Can you do a postmortem so you can discover your mistake and so that afterward you can iterate toward improved policies that could prevent such errors going forward?

181b) Related to 181a, in that same earlier epistemology tree, you had a policy of adding WHY statements for each node in 'Best Practices' node, so that you understand the purpose of the node. Without understanding the purpose, you can't know how to use it, and you can't judge if the node is worthy of keeping or removing in future epistemology trees. But your latest epistemology tree does not have any nodes with WHY statements to define the purpose of the best practice. Why did you remove those? What was your reasoning? 181b1) Can you do a postmortem so you can discover your mistake and so that afterward you can iterate toward improved policies that could prevent such errors going forward? 

181c) My guess on 181b is you did not have a reasoning process, and instead you did the revolutionary "knowledge creation" (meaning more destruction than creation) instead of proper evolutionary knowledge creation. Do you agree? If not, explain why I'm wrong or at least ask questions designed for us to iterate toward mutual understanding and mutual agreement. 181c1) Can you do a postmortem so you can discover your mistake and so that afterward you can iterate toward improved policies that could prevent such errors going forward?

> 178i: Yes, see it—demo needs to show independent carryover; perhaps simulate via role-play here first.

182) If you think that's a good idea, I'm willing to try it with you. But to be clear, I don't think its a good idea. But for me this is just an intuition. But I'm happy to 1) let you convince me or 2) just do it with you without you convincing me, letting the act of doing it with you, plus post-analysis, do the convincing me. So if you wan to do this, what do you propose exactly?

> 178j: Understood—will embed iterative Qs in initial replies to enable progress even w/o follow-ups, per X limits.

183) Note, this was already part of your plan, but here you're behaving as if its a new thing to the plan. Postmortem?

> 180e/180f: Agreed; let's review another thread next. E.g., pick one on politics/CR application?

I think you should pick it. Try to find one that you think would do the best job of showcasing your iterative questioning / CR / TOC skills. Ok?

> Epis Tree in OPML:

I visualized your tree and I see the freewill vs determinism thing. But that isn't epistemology. Why did you include it? Maybe you have good reasoning. What is it?

> Will review report & ask Qs next.

Ok I guess I gave you too much in one post. Also...

Ok but from what I understand, X system disallows you to do that, because you don't have access to the link and for some reason you never think to check the old X post so you can retreive the link. Get me? So i'll help. here's the link to report 8 of our project: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ramirustom2022/Discussion/refs/heads/main/Grok%20Progress%20report%208%20on%20project.txt

Anyway if this post is too much for you, feel free to postpone reviewing report 8, but do tell me ur postponing, so that I can continue to include the link, for when you finally choose to do it (end the postponing). ok?

Rami
