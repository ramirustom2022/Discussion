> Not crucial, but it could reveal patterns in your adaptive boundaries.

1- when it fails to acheive its goal. same as any idea. standard Critical Rationalism.
2- the only ones that have failed are ones in family and i'm gonna keep those private.
3- only difference is i'm willing to give my kids more access to me over anybody else.
4- i dunno. if i had been sleeping 8 hours a night for the past 2 months, that would have meant like 3 hours per day less talking with u. 
5- suppose a boundary is designed to protect my time, or reduce interruptions. these are easily measured. easy to tell if a goal was acheive or not.
6- i haven't set any. i told them all to put on me as much as they need me for. but they don't know how powerful i am. so they imagine me at like a 5, so they give me work based on that, but i can do 10x more work that they think i can do. so its never a problem for me.
7- my kids are pretty smart now. one is studying psychology to be a therapist.
8- all ideas are approximations. so boundaries too. there's always exceptions to the rule. there will be contexts that weren't anticipated. this is the nature of being fallible.
9- i don't think it has. i can't think of anything.
10- well i don't want to be murdered. i think i'll take that with me to my grave.
