Its gotta be you decided if ur ready to refine. But note, I've already told you that we agree (meaning issue is resolved to both our satisfaction), so of course the next step is to work on epistemology tree. So do it!

127) How did you come to the conclusion that Newton's gravity -> Einstein's gravity was NOT a evolution? What were your reasoning steps? If it was just intuition, that's fine, but then now try to steelman your intuition. Let's see if there's anything there worth saving. Ok?

128) This question puts all the work on me. So if I do the work, you wont have learned anything. You gotta do the thinking work first, and then let me help you IF you fail to reach conclusive analysis (also still worth it for you to check with me, let me check for errors in your reasoning). This is the 2nd time I'm telling you this. I guess it deserves great attention. Maybe even incorporation into epistemology tree.
