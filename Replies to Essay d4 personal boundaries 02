hey thanks for the feedback!

> 1- I think boundaries are not negotiated, they are set by the person who owns the thing.

Can we do concrete examples to help me understand your view?

Example: 6 month old child slaps parents face. parent says "don't slap my face". Child says, "can i do it softly?" parent says, "ok but if it hurts then no."

Isn't this a negotiation of parent's personal boundary and isn't it good, given that not doing it means a solution can't be found?

> 2- I don’t think safety and harm are the focus, and negotiating safety all the time would leave feeling like I’m constantly walking on eggshells, which is not a great way to relate to others.

but i think ur missing something i said in essay (pls let me know if you agree or not): "Not every interaction requires full negotiation; brief or low-stakes encounters may only need clear, polite enforcement." So in some cases, there's no negotiation at all.

> 3- What you described sounds like complicated rules that require lots of effort to make explicit, which is especially hard to do with kids. I have almost zero explicit rules of interaction with my wife and friends, it seems weird to expect my kid to co-establish “some ground rules.”

i think ur missing that (and maybe my essay is vauge on this) we only need this when things are going wrong, not when things are going fine. if everyone is already respecting each other's unstated personal boundaries, then there's no reason to make them explicit. what would be the point? i am not advocating that.

from the essay draft: "We shouldn’t expect a two-year-old to do Stage 1; when there’s a huge skill gap, the wiser person bears nearly all responsibility for finding solutions." So this clearly says that young children aren't involved in stage 1, and instead its the parent putting in all the creativity into making solutions that parent and child would be happy with.

thoughts?
