> 139: Agreed—phrasing "leans" introduces ambiguity/nonsense; it's refuted (binary). Adding to epis tree under "Pitfalls": "Avoid probabilistic phrasing in binary contexts (WHY: Prevents unclear conclusions)."

141) To be clear, I do sometimes use the "leans" toward a theory phrasing. But that's only when I want to say that I have an intuition telling me something, but I don't have conclusive analysis yet. But in your case, that's not the situation. You had already done a ton of work. So what you should now be saying and doing is this:

142a) List the rival theories - theories that claim to solve the same problem. 142b) Determine which rivals have flaws (rivals do not have it). 142c) See if there is a theory which does not have flaws, meaning all rivals have flaws. 142d) If yes, then that theory is non-refuted status while the rivals are refuted status - ie. a conclusive answer.

That's the same thing Einstein did to iterate from Newton's gravity and Maxwell's EM. Do you see?

>   - Pitfalls: Degrees logic sans wrappers leads to uncertainty (still there; not deleted).

btw that's not very clear to me compared to the much more clear thing u were doing before with these characters: ├── │  └──  (pls switch back to this)

> Share your judgment?

I don't see any flaws, looks fine to me. But if you want me to really scrutinize this, I would need the OPML formatted text so I can visualize it in mindmap software.

yes lots of progress!!!!

i think ur doing better every single day, and each day's improvement is signifcatly bigger than the last.
