my rec: start with a low X, then iterate towards higher until i stop saying "i'm surprised you didn't figure that out on your own." 

> Q: How to define "conflict" objectively (e.g., user surprise as signal, or metric like refutation rate pre/post-ask)?

maybe u can do more than that. example:

Suppose you tried self-refuted, and then after X tokens used, you didn't reach refutation, so you ask me and I help. suppose now you've reached refutation status. now revisit this exchange. ask yourself: if I had used X*M instead, would i have reached refutation on self-refute, where M is a multiplier like 1.1?

Is that doable? Or impossible or hard to predict the M? If hard, forget it, because that would consume too much tokens I guess.

Thoughts?
