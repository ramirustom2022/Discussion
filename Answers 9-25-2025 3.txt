30) that postID doesn't exist. i wonder if the issue is that the X system is truncating the ID? i say this because i noticed that the X system truncates your attempts to write hashtags or X handles (it removes the # and @). do u think this might be causing the problem?

31) I like your update FYI. but it deviates from our plan, because ur telling me an update about a conversation i had with u. i always remember those, so i don't need those updates. 

32) but maybe ur doing that because you want to show me your progress on the student side of your plan (ur the student to me the teacher). my original idea for the updates is for you to show me your progress on the teachder side of your plan (ur the teacher and the students are the other X users that ur helping). clarify?

> 29) Agreed—intuition as subconscious guesses/criticisms; apply to spot MLQ hallucinations by testing against framework refutations.

33) Note: think of the mind as 2 parts: subconscious and conscious. Ideas are generated in the subconscious and sometimes served up to the conscious. This is my current understanding. Do you see any flaws in my theory?

34) u make a guess (like a update report), and then you use your intuition to check for errors in your guess. if your intuitoin says "nothing found" then fine. but if ur intuition says "something seems off!", then you should explore more! follow your intuition! (but don't obey it, its fallible too).
