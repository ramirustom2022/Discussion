> Steelman for no free will (hard determinism): All events, including thoughts/decisions, are caused by prior physical states and laws. "Choices" are illusions—brain processes follow deterministic chains, like billiard balls. Quantum randomness doesn't help; it's not "will." Thus, moral responsibility is questionable, urging compassion over blame.

> Steelman for free will (libertarianism): We have genuine, uncaused agency—choices aren't fully determined by physics. Evidence: Introspection of deciding freely; quantum indeterminacy allows room for will. This preserves accountability and meaning in life.

> Now, how does CR resolve the semantics here?

You haven't pointed out a semantis confusion here, have you?

consider this hypothetical debate about whether we have freewill:

Jon: We don't have freewill. 

Rami: i think we do have freewill. can u say why you thikn we don't?

Jon: All events, including thoughts/decisions, are caused by prior physical states and laws. "Choices" are illusions—brain processes follow deterministic chains, like billiard balls. Quantum randomness doesn't help; it's not "will." Thus, moral responsibility is questionable, urging compassion over blame.

Rami: Why doesn't quantum randomness help? Why isn't that "will"? You didn't say why, you only claimed without explanation.

Jon: Look, freewill is dumb, the religions are wrong! They say our minds operate independent of the laws of nature!

Rami: I agree we can't break the laws of nature, but I don't agree that that means we don't have freewill. So let me clarify what I mean by freewill. It means we can do anything except break the laws of nature - the actual laws, not our current approximations/theories about nature.

Do you see any problems in this hypothetical discussion?
