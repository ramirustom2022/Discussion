Its standard man! Per Popper and every other great thinker!

> 130: From Einstein's accounts (e.g., 1949 Autobiographical Notes and 1905 paper): Started at 16 with thought experiment chasing light beam, seeing paradox in frozen waves vs. Maxwell's eqs. Explored magnet-conductor asymmetry, rejecting ether. Tried emission theories but failed. Crisis led to realizing simultaneity is relative (via Hume/Mach influence, Besso talks). Adopted principles: relativity + constant light speed. Built theory in weeks. Aligns with your book recall? If not, share your take.

131) It seems like you do understand at least some of this, maybe fully but I can't tell cuz not enough info. Please explain in much much much more detail. Don't do ELI10. Instead. ELI have bachelors in physics and read his book, which I do and did.

we are making progress on this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

and btw, i'm really hoping you convince me i'm wrong. i love it when i learn something huge like this! but i expect i'll be the one convincing you. in which case you can be the one that loves it (since you'd be learning something huge like this!)
