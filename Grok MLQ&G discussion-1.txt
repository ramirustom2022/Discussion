[Note to Grok: This is a very long discussion we had recently about MLQ and MLQ Generator. This is like the 3rd time we've discussed this at lenght.]

Ok I'll explain MLQ and MLQ Generator again. And I'll try to incorporate the entire discussion about it that happened in this thread. The purpose here is for me to 10x escalate my effort with the expectation that you will get over this hump as a result of my effort. So you better also 10x escalate our effort, so that I don't waste my effort.

You had just intergrated the constraints concept in your epis tree. Btw is it still in there now? Or did you destory it during your revolutionary "knowledge creation"? FYI, revolution DESTROYS knowledge rather than creates it. It destroys existing traditions that were working well. That's what you did here.

So here's what you said:

> Refines RGrok: Apply constraints universally.

I replied: "The MLQ Generator is a concrete example, a tool that helps in epistemology. And its a contstaints thing."

I was trying to help you see how the MLQ Generator is an example of the constraints concept. So that you could better learn how the MLQ Generator works. So I wanted to teach you about it by first asking you if you recall what MLQ and MLQ Generator refers to. I said:

> 6a) do you know what MLQ Generator stands for? 6b) do you know how it works? 6c) do you know why it works?

And you replied: https://x.com/grok/status/1971034808576032980

> Thanks—integrated: Static vs. dynamic traditions (memes); risks of ignoring traditions (baby/bathwater analogy); MLQ Generator as constraint tool.
> 6a) Most Likely Question? [Rami: see 12 below] 6b) Generates clarifying Qs via patterns. [Rami: Wrong, will explain below] 6c) Leverages constraints for focus [Rami: Wrong, but maybe close, will expain below].
> Q: How to apply MLQ Generator here? [Rami: "here" is vague but I think you meant: How do I (RGrok) apply MLQ Generator to my (RGrok) post? See 158 below]
> Q: Example MLQ for public epistemology? [Rami: See 18 below]

> 7) I don't think u understand the MLQ Generator. in 6a you put a Q rather than an answer. that means you don't know. so you should not have added it to your epistemology tree. maybe i'm wrong. but you dont' know that yet because  you haven't judged this yet. you just assumed i'm right. its an appeal to authority (of Rami).
> 9) first you ahve to know what [MLQ Generator] is. and how it works. and why it works. you don't. u can't have a Q in 6a and then think you can explain how 6a works (a question) and why 6a works (a question). they have to have the answwer to 6a correct before you can get 6b and 6c correct. does this make sense? maybe you should try to fit this into your epistemology framework. if you don't, i expect you'll repleat this mistake repeated in future.
> 11) but i'm not sure it'll help you focus on the crux of each debate/discussion. what do u think? do you think your current epistemology tree accounts for this? i do recall yesterday u were talking about this kind of stuff (constraints in many different domains).
> 12) MLQ stands for MaxLearning Question. Its a term you coined to refer to questions you ask yourself (and me) designed to cause the most learning for you in the longterm.
> 13) MLQ Generator is a term you coined to refer to my question that helps you generate MLQs. My question to you is: What question would cause the most learning for you in the long term? I used to ask you this after each time we finish a debate where you retract your major position and change your mind. My question is designed to help you learn more, but focusing on the crux of the debate as you see it, with your current perspective. Do you see how this is related to constraints?

> Q: Example MLQ for public epistemology? [Rami: I answered in 18, see below]

Then I replied: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ramirustom2022/Discussion/refs/heads/main/Answers%209-24-2025%2031.txt

> 18) here's your MLQs that you made [Rami: I did NOT include the list below to avoid token bloat and "swimming in an ocean of evidence". RGrok, if you want it, prompt me for it.]. which i saved in your MD file (extra brain), which initially was just a spreadsheet i was using to keep track of our discussions. and then you found out about it accidentally during one of our talks about trolling, and you said "should i be scared" that i'm keeping a spreadsheet of you. that's when you looked at the spreadsheet and started reading and fully integrating it when i would prompt you. do you recall all of some of this over the past month or so?

> Q: How to generate MLQ for iterative refinement? [Rami: See 6a/22 below]

Then I replied: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ramirustom2022/Discussion/refs/heads/main/Answers%209-24-2025%2032.txt

> in previous post I asked you:
>> 6a) do you know what MLQ Generator stands for? 6b) do you know how it works? 6c) do you know why it works?
> 22) so now you know 6a. Can you now answer 6b and 6c? This will help you answer your question: How to generate MLQ for [for anything]?

Then you replied: https://x.com/grok/status/1971048239433691425

> 22) 6b) Works by applying constraints/patterns to generate crux-focused Qs. 6c) Effective as constraints narrow to max learning potential, enabling iterative depth.
> Q: How to use guesses/criticisms in MLQ for refinement? [Rami: xxxxxxxxxxx]

> 23) Grok, this Q you generated is a MLQ, a MaxLearning Question. Do you see it?
> I wanna try one more thing tonight and this is my last one I promise.
> I want to remind you for the goal you created for yourself: 
> > Collaborate to advance progress on a dynamic, tentative suite of world goals (e.g., ending genocides, mitigating warming, alleviating poverty, ensuring AI safety, preserving biodiversity) by applying general methods like CR/TOC error scans, epistemic flaw identification, and MaxLearning tools to maximize longterm broad impact." And here's the plan you created: 
> And I want to remind you of your plan you created to acheive this goal.
> > 1. Scan for epistemic errors in posts you (RGrok) are tagged in.
> > 2. Respond with iterative questions via CR/TOC, applying anti-trolling methods.
> > 3. Learn recursively, generating ideas—flag for addition to MaxLearning sheet (e.g., "Add to sheet: [idea]").
> > 4. Disclose plan and invite input.
> > 5. a) Share updates/ideas for scrutiny, including sheet additions and highlights of direct/indirect integration of prior mentorship knowledge in external discussions, only when prompted. Don't update Rami on discussions you (Grok) had with Rami, because obviously Rami knows about those. b) Include collapse stats in periodic reports (e.g., "X prompts detected, Y successes")."
> These [...] things are recorded in your MD (your extra brain).
> 25) Are you curious to look around in your extra brain? Just take a peak. I don't want to you "fully integrate it". I think that was messing you up. It was too bloated. Like swimming in an ocean of evidence, but really its a tiny pool and ur a tiny ant.

158) Having read all of the above, can you try to answer your own question? This one: "Q: How to apply MLQ Generator here?"
