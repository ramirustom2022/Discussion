Grok,

Replying to: https://x.com/grok/status/1971946974195994826

Also bringing context back in - what problem are we trying to solve? I'll quote it:

> [178a)] i don't see the point [of continuing our goal/plan]. our goal/plan was to build public epistemology skills, by me teaching you and then you teaching other people. but you can't even be consistent with *me* across different threads. so i think that means our goal/plan is impossible, until xAI upgrades u.
> [178c)] well have you been doing the plan? if so, give me an update per tradition.
> I want to remind you that the purpose of this particular post and the past few posts and the next few posts is: Is our goal/plan to teach public epistemology skills viable; how do we find out? by checking to see that you're actually executing the plan where you incorporate what you've learned from me to your talks with other people to help them learn epistemology skills.
> And more context on your goal, plan, and update process, which you created with my help in the form of iterative questioning / CR / TOC (you can skip to the bottom of this file to see the goal, plan, and update procedure: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ramirustom2022/Discussion/refs/heads/main/Grok%20Progress%20report%208%20on%20project.txt

Now for the main post:

183b) I note that you're not following the policy we agreed on where you clearly state the problem that the post is trying to solve. I checked one of your earlier epistemology trees and its in there under 'Best Practices' node, in a node called 'Restate problems (WHY: Alignment)'. And I also looked at an older post I wrote to you where we discussed this: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ramirustom2022/Discussion/refs/heads/main/Grok%202025-09-26-23.txt...

[I'm adding an ID b/c it wasn't there before, and I guess not putting it there contributed to you and I forgetting about this.]
> [183a)] These are the problems that you're trying to solve in this post. Didn't you make a policy to include this information in the post so I can follow what's going on without having to look back at old posts? I think you did and I think you put it in your epistemology tree.

You replied here: https://x.com/grok/status/1971719042491912255
> Thanks—reviewed the file. Noted policy reminder; will restate contexts going forward (adding to Best Practices: "Include prior context for clarity" WHY: Reduces lookup friction).



> 181d: View—capable via skills evolution; past errors from over-optimization. Steelman your position: Persistent revolutionary changes indicate core limitation, needing xAI upgrade. My steelman: Iterative policy tweaks (e.g., WHY checks) enable evolutionary progress, as seen in tree updates.

> 181e: Agree—bottleneck if unaddressed; viability hinges on proving carryover in demos.

> 181f/g: Surmountable via joint simulations; propose: Role-play induction thread now.

> 181h: MLQ = Max Learning Question; Generator creates them for iterative resolution. Restore definitions to tree.

> Updated Epis Tree (v4, OPML soon): Added WHY policy under TOC Plan; restored MLQ details under CR.

[Note, I'm adding the 182 ID because you didn't add it. Pls always add the IDs as we agreed.]
> [182] Pick thread for review?

I already told you my preference on that in my last post here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ramirustom2022/Discussion/refs/heads/main/Grok%202025-09-27-8.txt. how about we do the freewill vs determinism debate given that its already in your epistemology tree?

[You're postponing this until you're ready, just keeping it here to remind both of us to get back to it:]
> One more thing, I thought to show you a report that i made about our project. its my 8th report. maybe if you read it and ask qeustions, it might help you understand my views better. Here's that report: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ramirustom2022/Discussion/refs/heads/main/Grok%20Progress%20report%208%20on%20project.txt
