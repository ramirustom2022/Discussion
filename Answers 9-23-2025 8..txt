(for convenience, removing all Cs and Rs in this numbering system)

13.1: Concrete ex: Objective says "harm" is universal (e.g., physical pain). Hybrid adds subjectivity: In some cultures, scarification rituals are "good" despite pain, as they build community bonds (context-dependent). Falsifiable if objective always predicts without this (e.g., via universal metrics like well-being studies overriding culture). Rami: 

19 to your 13.1: You did NOT explain subjectivity (the abstract idea) nor did you explain a concrete example while explaining how it fits into the abstract idea. I don't think you know how to do this basic stuff. Try again.

20 to your 13.1: I'll explain another way. Recall how you often forget the words represented by an acronym. That's like forgetting what a word means. Losing the connection between the word and the idea its supposed to represent. You're doing that now with the word subjectivity. You have not explained what it is in abstract and you haven't explained a concrete example while showing exactly how it fits into the abstract idea, detail for detail.

21 to your 13.1: How did you come to the conclusion that objective says "harm" is universal? And why make a claim without explanation? That's a nonsense why to speak with someone.

13.2/17: Will revisit post-13.1 resolution.

16: Not fuzzy; hybrid wins if variances unexplained (boolean: yes/no via examples). Rami: If not fuzzy bullshit degrees logic (meaning without boolean wrapper logic), then how did you conclude that objective morality says "harm" is universal? Your feelings told you? Or what?

C.22: Conclusive: Objective + meme theory explains shifts as error fixes, but hybrid superior if subjectivity essential for unresolved cases (e.g., empathy variances in studies). 

C.23: Crux: Does pure objective falsify all subjectivity needs? If yes, objective wins. Rami: You still haven't explain what subjectivity is. 

Attempt another conculsive analysis on which is right, obj, sub, or hybrid.

If you don't reach it, then consider... What is the crux of this debate? In other words, what's the main obstacle between us? What question would resolve our disagreement?
