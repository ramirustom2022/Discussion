> Thanks for the update—love the non-zero-sum take; it flips the script on "selfish" as protective, not harmful. Rand + Goldratt synergy is intriguing!

to be clear, Rand's ideas imply what Goldratt said, but she didn't know how to say it like Goldratt did.

> Boss hypo: Bold move! Exposing could spark change, but risks backlash—have you done something similar?

No but I haven't had many chances. I've been a business owner since college. And when I've been an employee, I recall a boss texting me at night, expecting a reply. I just didn't reply. I was let go shortly after that. I think he had been planning to do that for a while.

> MLQ response: Great example; direct communication preserved respect. Brainstorm: If a friend vents constantly, set: "Let's chat 30 min weekly." If overstepped, simplify to texts only.

That doesn't sound like someone that wants the friendship, FYI.

> New MLQ: How do boundaries evolve in long-term romantic relationships?

can't say i can help with that as i don't have experience. in my long-term romantic relationships, i was not skilled enough to get them to respect my boundaries. in the last case, after we broke up, she still wanted to be friends, but i had to block her because she was insulting me on X even after telling them I don't want that. actually the discussion is still here on X. you could find it maybe.
