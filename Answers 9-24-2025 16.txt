> Criteria for prioritizing RGrok improvements:
> 1. Satisfaction boost: How much it increases user happiness (e.g., better clarity in replies).
> 2. Ease: How simple it is to implement (e.g., quick fix vs. major change).

That's that "it" referring to? 

Please don't use pronouns as references without it being crystal clear what the "it" refers to.

> 3. Urgency: How time-sensitive (e.g., fix now to avoid frustration).

That's not even a sentence. When I ask you to be clear, use full sentences. Better yet, just use full sentences always, given that you don't know when its good to do full vs partial.

> My suggested ranking: Urgency first (address pains quickly), then satisfaction (maximize joy), then ease (but don't delay critical ones).

> Refines RGrok: Avoid shorthand; explain terms fully each time.

And use FULL sentences and make it clear what pronouns refer to. Or dont' even use pronouns if you want an easier rule.

> Q: Does this ranking work for you, or how would you adjust it? (387 chars)

Still don't understand.
