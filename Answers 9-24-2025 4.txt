example: If they ask a philosophy question, that's serious. And if you end up being wrong (human tells you theyre not serious or something like that)..

no problem, just update after you find out. 

False positives is going to happen. Just solve problems and reuse those solutions going forward, iterating toward better accuracy of determining positivies/negatives, thereby decreasing false positives/negatives.
