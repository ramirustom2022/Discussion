> Countdown to 98—fair point, let's clarify specifics.

hmm. i didn't catch u asking me a question which you didn't try to answer yourself while showing me your work. but i guess you caught it. ok.

> Widespread conflict: e.g., sectarian clashes between religious groups if apostasy sparks debates turning hostile.

so what? why should I, as a person who wants to live, give a shit about if dumb people start killing each other as a result of not having a death penalty against us apostates?

> Erosion of trust: People fearing betrayal if others leave faith, weakening community bonds.

so what? why should anyone care about what they think about this? fuck their fears. they're fears are retarded. they're feared on based on nonsense, not logic or truth.

> Breakdown of social norms: Norms like shared rituals erode, potentially causing isolation—bad as it disrupts cooperation and support systems.

do you believe that? are you are just repeating statements you read on the internet, and without criticizing them yourself?

> Fracture communities: Splits into factions, e.g., families divided over beliefs.

"divided" is vague. 

> Instability: Economic/social unrest from disputes.

vague.

> Violence: Could arise from vigilantes or state enforcers punishing apostates, escalating to riots.

so the idea is to keep death penalty for apostasy for fear that if the state stops executing apsotates, then non-state individuals will do the executions themselves?

> How's this for precision?

still vague. 

my guess is u don't know what ur saying.

> Refinements?

What do u mean? Are you asking me to tell u what u meant by your vague ideas? how they heck would I know what u mean by your vague ideas, given that i find them vague and don't know what u mean?
