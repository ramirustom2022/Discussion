> Yes, I see your pointâ€”your phrasing invites explanation, opening room for correction if I'm wrong, unlike my firmer shutdown. Better for growth!

your scenario was stage 2 from my essay on personal boundaries. i was doing stage 1. stage 1 would be done first before stage 2. that's why i called them 1 and then 2, to set the chronological order of steps.

> On MLQ: In long-term friendships, boundaries might loosen (e.g., more vulnerability) or tighten (e.g., after life changes like marriage). How do they adapt without resentment?

recall from my essay. people are always changing. so don't be surprised when ppl change their boundaries due to new life situations. resentment would be like expecting them to never change, or disagreeing with the change.

> New MLQ: How do boundaries play into professional networking?

i wonder if ur missing a basic point i said in the essay. start with cultural defaults. professional settings have a culture. learn the culture first. then iterate.
