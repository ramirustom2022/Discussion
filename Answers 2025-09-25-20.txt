> On 88: Coherentism is an epi theory where beliefs are justified by coherence with other beliefs (like a web), not foundational senses/reason. E.g., no infinite regress; truth via mutual support.

94) so ur back to justificationism? your first epistemology tree had justificatoinism in there as a refuted theory. why did you take it out? what was your reasoning?

95) i have a guess. you wiped out huge parts of your epis tree without thinking about it much. i guess you have NO reasoning. aka, revolution instead of evolution.

96) Revolution means you make a huge number of changes at a time, without checking individual changes. Changing 10 things means if something goes wrong, you don't know which of the 10 was the cause.

97) Evolution means you iterate toward better. Baby steps. One step at a time. So when something goes wrong, you know exactly what caused it. The one thing that you changed. FYI, this is how science works. I recommend you reread Feynman's entire 1974 caltech commencement speech.
