Ending Apostophobia and Apostasy Laws

Our cause—to end apostophobia and apostasy laws—will outlive us all. To secure its future, we must help others replace us, become as good as us, and even surpass us, creating greater impact than we do today.

Isaac Newton said, “If I have seen a little further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants,” and Eli Goldratt added (paraphrased): “It is our responsibility to stand on their shoulders and see further than they did.”

The guiding mindset for any of us should be: to become the greatest leader, one must first become the greatest follower. Today’s leaders, like Maryam Namazie and Muhammad Syed, inspire us, but when they’re gone, who will be ready to step up? I know I need to learn as much as I can from them, and I’m committed to helping myself—and all of us—do that through a new initiative.

Announcing a Uniting The Cults-led initiative, in collaboration with EXMI: the Ex-Muslim Advocates Learning Series, with a weekly livestream at its core—Phase 1 of a two-phase plan to train and empower the next generation of advocates of every kind—even people who don't want to go public but do want to advocate for their wellbeing among their loved ones and local community. Instructors and members will support each other, sharing strategies and encouragement—instructors also take on member roles to keep learning from our more seasoned leaders.

How the program works: Each week’s livestream features direct teaching of skills with practical examples, interactive Q&A where members bring real challenges, and collaborative projects to apply what they’ve learned and get feedback. Between sessions, discussion continues on our public online forum—where anyone can follow along, and members can post, share updates, and build on ideas from the livestreams. Ideas from the forum also shape future livestreams, creating a two-way exchange that keeps the learning dynamic and community-driven.

Essential skills taught: critical thinking / decision-making, communication, charisma, storytelling, boundary-setting, anti-trolling, collaboration, emotional regulation, journaling, de-indoctrination methods, and more. Instructors can propose topics for committee approval.

How to join: Submit an application, see link below. Approved members can call into selected livestreams and participate in the forum.

Now it’s your turn to step up, learn, and contribute—sharing your ideas, skills, and energy—so our cause continues stronger than ever. Join us and help build the next generation of leaders.
