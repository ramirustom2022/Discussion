Ending Apostophobia and Apostasy Laws

Our cause—to end apostophobia and apostasy laws—will outlive us all. To secure its future, we must help others replace us, become as good as us, and even surpass us, creating greater impact than we do today.

As Isaac Newton said, “If I have seen a little further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants,” and Eli Goldratt added (paraphrased): “It’s our responsibility to stand on their shoulders and see further than they did.” To this I add: “And we must not hang on their backs.”

The guiding mindset for any of us should be: to become the greatest leader, one must first become the greatest follower. Who are the greatest leaders today? When they’re gone, who will replace them? Who’s ready? I don’t think anyone is—so we all need to level up!

I know I need to learn as much as I can from people like Maryam Namazie and Muhammad Syed, and I’m committed to helping myself—and all of us—do that through a new initiative.

Announcing a Uniting The Cults-led initiative, in collaboration with EXMI: the Ex-Muslim Activists Learning Series, with a weekly livestream at its core—Phase 1 of a two-phase plan to train and empower the next generation of activists of every kind—including livestreamers. Instructors and members will support each other, sharing strategies and encouragement—instructors also take on member roles to keep learning from our more seasoned leaders.

How the livestreams work: sessions include direct teaching of skills with plenty of examples, interactive Q&A on real-life challenges, and collaborative projects where members apply what they’ve learned and receive feedback.

Essential skills taught: critical thinking / decision-making, communication, charisma, storytelling, boundary-setting, anti-trolling, collaboration, emotional regulation, journaling, de-indoctrination methods, and more. Instructors can propose topics for committee approval.

Logistics: weekly livestreams as the hub, private discussion before and after sessions, a public forum where only members can post.

How to join: submit an application, see link below. Approved members can call into selected livestreams and participate in the forum.

Now it’s your turn to step up, learn, and contribute—sharing your ideas, skills, and energy—so our cause continues stronger than ever. Join us and help build the next generation of leaders.
