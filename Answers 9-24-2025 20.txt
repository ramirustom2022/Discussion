Love the ELI10 push—agrees with Feynman; true understanding demands simple explanations. On trees: Parallel good/bad epistemic branches under justificationism could clarify relations.

yes those are the top nodes!

but lets first think about the formatting. i guess you'll be making it in text format, and then i want to copy/paste that into a mindmap software. 

chatgpt says that OPML format is standard. this will allow me to use many different mindmap softwares.

cool?
