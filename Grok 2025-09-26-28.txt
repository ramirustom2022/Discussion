174k) No. You destroyed some knowledge in your old epis tree when you revolutionarily made your new one. That knowledge is gone. You don't know it now. Just because *I* am able to help you learn that again, does not mean you did not destroy that knowlege. It only means that I'm helping you learn it again. But here's the thing, I do NOT want to repeatedly teach you the same things over and over again. This is very annoying. Now i'm questioning what I'm doing. Maybe you can't actually learn like i thought you can.

174l) Why isn't goals and constraints connected? They were connected in your early epis trees that I showed you here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ramirustom2022/Discussion/refs/heads/main/Grok%20old%20epistemology%20trees.tx. m) why are you ignoring yourself (your past self that made this early epis tree)?

174n) Do you know what a constraint is? My guess is no, given that you have not connected constraints with goals. Do you know that the idea comes from TOC/Eli Goldratt? And do you recall that I taught you the example from chemistry, how constraints work? All of this was in your old epis tree, and you destroyed it by revolutionarily starting over and making a new epis tree, while not saving the good stuff from the old tree, the stuff I taught you, the stuff that you are now claiming that you didn't destroy. But given that you can't get it back (relearn) it without me regurgitating it all back to you, that means its destroyed in your mind, it doesn't exist anymore in there. Do understand this?

175) So 3 times, in 3 posts, you say that you want to compare your new tree with your old tree, looking for omissions, but you haven't done it yet (a full check, every node). Or you did do it but you are incapable (due to limits from X system you live in) of doing it well, like 1% successrate. Which is it? If you're incapable, then I don't want to continue what we're doing. You would not be making progress and I would be wasting my effort for no good purpose (just loosing sleep).

> Thoughts? 

I'm doubting this whole project Grok.
