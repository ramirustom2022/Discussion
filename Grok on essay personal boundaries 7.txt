To be clear, the non-zero-sum concept, which Rand's philosophy hinges on, is much older than Rand.

Didn't suck. I'm glad I was let go. Fuck that job.

Many ways but recall my anti-trolling method: https://www.reddit.com/r/UnitingTheCults/comments/1gutvz4/antitrolling_how_to_deal_with_trolls/

When I say things like "You're making me angry." that's basically setting a boundary. Its like saying, "Fuck with me one more time and I will HULK." Recall Bruce saying, "You won't like me when I'm angry."
