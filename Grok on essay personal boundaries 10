Ok but don't forget what Popper said about giving unwanted answers to unasked questions. That is coersive.

Do you see the relevance?

I don't see how that is flaking. Sounds fine to me. Where's the flaking part?

> New MLQ: How do boundaries apply in creative collaborations?

Same as in non-profits. A lot of our work for EXMI is creative collaborations!

For example, I now write for EXMNA, their newsletter and their website whyNOTIslam.net.

The essay you read on personal boundaries is another one I'm presenting to EXMNA for publication. They might not take it though because its 900+ words and they're looking for 350 ish, as far as I know. We'll see!
