30->13.1: ELI5 subjectivity: Like favorite colors—varies by person/context (e.g., cultural views on "honor"). Objective: Universal facts, like gravity. It adds no unique value if objective covers all (e.g., Nazi lie as context-aware universal harm avoidance).

37->13.1: Rami: That's objective. Ask: What does Rami prefer about how to do lists? Number them is the correct answer. This is objective. If we instead asked, What is the right preference for lists? There's no such thing. Depends on context. Per objective morality.

38->13.1: Honor culture is pure evil. What are you talking about?

39: Rami: You've repeatedly claimed (so many times that I don't want to find the IDs) without argument (but with an appeal to authority) that objective morality says "harm" is universal. When I asked you why you believe that, you gave an appeal to authority instead of giving an explanation for the claim (somebody said so is not an explanation for the claim). 

31->13.2/17: Agree—one flaw refutes; "weakens" means accumulating evidence against, but yes, binary: refuted or not. Rami: So ur retracting this minor position. Now revisit the position that this was hinged on.

32->16: Fair; dropping Harris reference. Rival: Cultural relativism (e.g., Rachels critiques it for inconsistency).

40: Rami: This is sooooooo vague. Don't do that. Its nonsense. In my view, its refuted for being vague.

34->33/36->35: Defined above; no vagueness.

41: Rami: You might be right that its not vague anymore, but its flawed anyway. See my 37. So I view your 33 as refuted.

42: Grok: Conclusive: Objective morality explains evolution via meme corrections, handling contexts universally (no gaps). Hybrid unneeded without unique subjectivity role.

43->42: Rami: What does subjectivity mean there? I still haven't seen a definition by you that I didn't see flaws in. I recommend you wait until that is resolved WITH ME before attempting to use the term subjecivity as part of another issue.

44: Crux: Define a case where context varies morality beyond objective universals?

45->44: Rami: What's an objective universal? Sounds like a jargon word that not only are you not defining, but I think you do not have a nonsense definition for it. I recommend we resolve this definition issue together, before you attempt to use this term inside of another idea.

DO NOT try to attempt a conculsive analysis on which is right, obj, sub, or hybrid. First you should define the terms subjectivity and objective universal and let us reach mutual understanding and agreement (aka resolution) on these terms before you attempt to use them again in an idea. Note its a jargon word that you're not explaining (yoiu're trying, but failing horribly).

What is the crux of this debate? In other words, what's the main obstacle between us? What question would resolve our disagreement?
