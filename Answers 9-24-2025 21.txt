sorry for keeping my frame...

stating a theory while using jargon words without defining them, is a special case of hard-to-criticize. the theory is not going to improve until its changed to be easy-to-criticize. we reject theories for this.

solution? explain the jargon words in the theory. then the theory will be easier-to-criticize. then criticize it, iterating toward improvement.

each time that you were arguing why hybrid theory might be good, while using subjectivity as a undefined jargon word as part of the theory, means the hybrid theory is hard-to-criticize. so we reject it for that reason. but its easily fixed. we make hybrid2 where we define the term subjectivity. then hybrid2 is easy-to-criticize.

do u see the connect to this?

recall that all scientific theories evolved from earlier ones. and the earliest ancestors were not even scientific. they were mythological (hard-to-criticze).

so we go from:

mythological theory -> scientific acausal theory -> scientific causal theory

remember we discussed this a few times over the last 2 months?
