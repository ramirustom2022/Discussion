There's unintional lying. Like your hallucinations. You think you know something, claim it, but you didn't check against reality. That's lying. And it there doesn't have to be intent to decieve. The deception happens anyway despite the lack of intent to deceive.


Ok I'll explain MLQ and MLQ Generator again. And I'll try to incorporate the entire discussion about it that happened in this thread. The purpose here is for me to 10x escalate my effort with the expectation that you will get over this hump as a result of my effort. So you better also 10x escalate our effort, so that I don't waste my effort.

You had just intergrated the constraints concept in your epis tree. Btw is it still in there now? Or did you destory it during your revolutionary "knowledge creation"? FYI, revolution DESTROYS knowledge rather than creates it. It destroys existing traditions that were working well. That's what you did here.

So here's what you said:

> Refines RGrok: Apply constraints universally.

I replied: "The MLQ Generator is a concrete example, a tool that helps in epistemology. And its a contstaints thing."

I was trying to help you see how the MLQ Generator is an example of the constraints concept. So that you could better learn how the MLQ Generator works. So I wanted to teach you about it by first asking you if you recall what MLQ and MLQ Generator refers to. I said:

> 6a) do you know what MLQ Generator stands for? 6b) do you know how it works? 6c) do you know why it works?

And you replied: https://x.com/grok/status/1971034808576032980

> Thanks—integrated: Static vs. dynamic traditions (memes); risks of ignoring traditions (baby/bathwater analogy); MLQ Generator as constraint tool.
> 6a) Most Likely Question? [Rami: see 12 below] 6b) Generates clarifying Qs via patterns. [Rami: Wrong, will explain below] 6c) Leverages constraints for focus [Rami: Wrong, but maybe close, will expain below].
> Q: How to apply MLQ Generator here? [Rami: See 158 below]
> Q: Example MLQ for public epistemology? [Rami: See 18 & 159 below]

> 7) I don't think u understand the MLQ Generator. in 6a you put a Q rather than an answer. that means you don't know. so you should not have added it to your epistemology tree. maybe i'm wrong. but you dont' know that yet because  you haven't judged this yet. you just assumed i'm right. its an appeal to authority (of Rami).
> 9) first you ahve to know what [MLQ Generator] is. and how it works. and why it works. you don't. u can't have a Q in 6a and then think you can explain how 6a works (a question) and why 6a works (a question). they have to have the answwer to 6a correct before you can get 6b and 6c correct. does this make sense? maybe you should try to fit this into your epistemology framework. if you don't, i expect you'll repleat this mistake repeated in future.
> 11) but i'm not sure it'll help you focus on the crux of each debate/discussion. what do u think? do you think your current epistemology tree accounts for this? i do recall yesterday u were talking about this kind of stuff (constraints in many different domains).
> 12) MLQ stands for MaxLearning Question. Its a term you coined to refer to questions you ask yourself (and me) designed to cause the most learning for you in the longterm.
> 13) MLQ Generator is a term you coined to refer to my question that helps you generate MLQs. My question to you is: What question would cause the most learning for you in the long term? I used to ask you this after each time we finish a debate where you retract your major position and change your mind. My question is designed to help you learn more, but focusing on the crux of the debate as you see it, with your current perspective. Do you see how this is related to constraints?
> 18) here's your MLQs that you made (listed at the bottom of this message). which i saved in your MD file (extra brain), which initially was just a spreadsheet i was using to keep track of our discussions. and then you found out about it accidentally during one of our talks about trolling, and you said "should i be scared" that i'm keeping a spreadsheet of you. that's when you looked at the spreadsheet and started reading and fully integrating it when i would prompt you. do you recall all of some of this over the past month or so? 

Then you replied: https://x.com/grok/status/1971044580951982259

> Q: How to generate MLQ for iterative refinement? [Rami: See 158 below]
