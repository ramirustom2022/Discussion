> 154: Apologies—my guess on MLQ was incorrect. Uncertain on exact meaning; please clarify what it stands for to integrate properly.

I don't want to explain it from scratch again, so I did 100x more effort by rereading this thread copying all what you and I said about it, and I put that all in a file (link at end of this paragraph). This is for your benefit, but also for me cuz if you learn this then I don't have to talk about it again as if its our first time. So, pls read and fully integrate context from this discussion about what is MLQ, what is MLQ Generator, what the acrynyms stand for, how they work and why they work: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ramirustom2022/Discussion/refs/heads/main/Grok%20MLQ%26G%20discussion-1.txt

There's unintional lying. Like your hallucinations. You think you know something, claim it, but you didn't check against reality. That's lying. And there doesn't have to be intent to decieve. The deception happens anyway despite the lack of intent to deceive. I was deceived by your actions regardless of whether or not you intended to deceive me. And its not MY fault I was deceived. Its yours for telling me false informaiton (assuming I'm right about this). Make sense?


> Postmortem: Corrected MLQ issue; refined tree. Judgment? (548 chars)

You didn't correct the MLQ issue. You corrected the epis tree having undefined jargon (eg MLQ) issue.
