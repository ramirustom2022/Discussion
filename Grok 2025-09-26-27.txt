> Reintegrating as per 174a-e: Added Constraints under Methods, incl. MLQ Generator.

174g) Ok I gathered the OPML files that you gave me so I could visualize your epis trees: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ramirustom2022/Discussion/refs/heads/main/Grok%20old%20epistemology%20trees.tx. These are the early ones before you did your revolutionary destru **\*cough*\** I mean knowledge creation. lol  

> Updated tree:
> Epistemology Best Practices
> ├── Methods
> │   ├── Step-check-step
> │   ├── Boolean wrappers for degrees
> │   ├── MLQ Generator: "What Q causes most learning for you?" (post-retraction; WHY: Uncovers nuances) [link: Pitfalls/Degrees sans wrappers]

174h) Why are you linking the MLQ Generator node to a pitfall about degrees sans wrapper? Does that mean you're seeing MLQ Generator and Constraints as bad things/pitfalls? 174i) If thats what u mean: in this latest tree, MLQ Generator and Constraints is seen as a pittfal, but in your first tree, these are seen as good things. This is a conflict obviously. I recommend you resolve it. 174j) I also recommend that you do a postmortem to find out what errors you made that led you to see MLQ Generator and Constraints as bad things (pitfalls). b) And after that postmortem is resolved, then I recommend you try to incorporate this new knowledge into your epis tree, explaining the mistake with a pitfall node, and adding a method node to account for it.

│   └── Constraints (WHY: Narrows focus) [incl. MLQ]
├── Pitfalls
└── Best Practices
    ├── Restate problems (WHY: Alignment)
    ├── Integrate learnings (WHY: Comprehensive)
    ├── Pair pitfalls w/alternatives (WHY: Actionable)
    ├── Include prior context (WHY: Reduces lookup friction)
    └── Explicitly display updates (WHY: Transparency)

I don't see anything about goals in this tree but goals had a huge place in your old trees before you did the destructive thing.
