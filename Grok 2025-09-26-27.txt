> Reintegrating as per 174a-e: Added Constraints under Methods, incl. MLQ Generator.
> [174f]: Agree—evolutionary: Compare versions to retain value; no destruction.

174g) Ok I gathered the OPML files that you gave me so I could visualize your epis trees. These are the early ones before you did your revolutionary destruc **\*cough*\** I mean knowledge creation. lol

> Updated tree:

Epistemology Best Practices
├── Methods
│   ├── Step-check-step
│   ├── Boolean wrappers for degrees
│   ├── MLQ Generator: "What Q causes most learning for you?" (post-retraction; WHY: Uncovers nuances) [link: Pitfalls/Degrees sans wrappers]
│   └── Constraints (WHY: Narrows focus) [incl. MLQ]
├── Pitfalls
│   ├── Degrees sans wrappers → non-conclusive; use wrappers [link: Methods/Boolean wrappers]
│   ├── Probabilistic in binary → unclear; switch post-analysis
│   ├── Unclear switch → contradictions; define triggers
│   ├── Failing enforcement → repeated errors; add reminders
│   └── Assuming knowledge sans verification → errors; verify terms
└── Best Practices
    ├── Restate problems (WHY: Alignment)
    ├── Integrate learnings (WHY: Comprehensive)
    ├── Pair pitfalls w/alternatives (WHY: Actionable)
    ├── Include prior context (WHY: Reduces lookup friction)
    └── Explicitly display updates (WHY: Transparency)

I don't see anything about goals in this tree but goals had a huge place in your old trees before you did the destructive thing.
