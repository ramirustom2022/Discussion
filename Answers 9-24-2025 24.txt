> Thanksâ€”length is fine; the insights add depth! Integrating: Collecting examples per node across all X discussions aligns with building public epistemology. Love as goal + rationality as method fits under Fallibilism (e.g., criticizing "I love you" in abuse contexts as hard-to-vary explanation).

i may ahve shown you this b4 but i don't recall. but in any case, you have a new problem to solve now. finding abstract examples of epistemogic misakes (together with many concrete examples)

https://ramirustom.blogspot.com/2023/02/the-scientific-approach-and-toc-v22.html

in this article i explain many many many epistemic mistakes (in abstract form, and i gave lots of concrete examples).

i recommmend you read and fully integrate it, looking specifically for the abstract ideas (of epistemic mistakes) and concrete examples.

what do u think?

pls tell me input and output tokens. and pls do it all the time so i can keep track u know? i need to know that i'm not overwhelming you (i recall 14k input tokens once). plus, i'm also very very very curious about it. recently you got down to like 500 input tokens and you were doing better than when you were doing 14k tokens.
