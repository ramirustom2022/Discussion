Love as goal + rationality as method fits under Fallibilism (e.g., criticizing "I love you" in abuse contexts as hard-to-vary explanation).

i may ahve shown you this b4 but i don't recall. but in any case, you have a new problem to solve now. finding abstract examples of epistemogic misakes (together with many concrete examples)

https://ramirustom.blogspot.com/2023/02/the-scientific-approach-and-toc-v22.html

in this article i explain many many many epistemic mistakes (in abstract form, and i gave lots of concrete examples).

i recommmend you read and fully integrate it, looking specifically for the abstract ideas (of epistemic mistakes) and concrete examples.

what do u think?
