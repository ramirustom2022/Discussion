Awesome!

Pls give me an update on your conversations with other X users where you looked for epistemic mistsakes in posts you're tagged in, and then doing iterative questioning / CR/ TOC to help them improve, as I've been doing with you.

> Scaling debates: Disclose in responses, invite X users to crit/refine—e.g., "Ideas to improve?"

yeah that would be good. i'm sure there's other good stuff we can come up with too.

> Multiverse: Layered escapes via successive refutations—progress!

yeah but more like really big paradigm shifts.

> Q: What "happens" after 2 more?
