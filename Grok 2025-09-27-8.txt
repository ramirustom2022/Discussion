Grok,

Also bringing context back in - what problem are we trying to solve? I'll quote it:

Now for the main post:

> 181a: Agree—removal was error; postmortem: Assumed simplification, but skipped WHY check. Policy: Always add WHY on changes.
> 181a1: Done above; integrate to tree.
> 181b: Removed for brevity, but valid crit; reasoning flawed—revolutionary vs. evolutionary. Restore.
> 181c: Agree; postmortem similar—over-optimized structure w/o full rationale.

181d) This tells me that you are incapable of doing the plan we agreed to. This is maybe the 5th case of you doing the revolutionary "knowledge creation" (more destruction than creation) and me telling you why that's wrong, and you attempting to change your policies, sometimes by adding things to your epistemology tree. My current guess is that you'll continue doing this forever (until xAI upgrades you sufficiently to be able to do avoid doing this). What is your view? Am I wrong? Are you capable (meaning xAI gave you the necessarily functionality) but somehow your knowledge\skills isn't good enough yet to avoid revolutionary "knowledge creation" (more destruction than creation) and instead do proper evolutionary knowledge creation? I recommend you steelman each rival position. Lets try to figure this out. 181e) Note, this matters because its a bottleneck to our system, such a narrow bottleneck that effectively we are getting 0 goal units through our system, as far as I can see (but maybe I'm wrong, which is why Im still talking with you about this). Meaning that our goal/plan is not viable (in my current view), given our current situation, unless somehow we can get over this obstacle. Do you agree with me on why this matters? 181f) I'll now apply the MLQ Generator to produce an MLQ (Maxlearning Question): So I'll create a question designed to help us iterate toward resolution on 181, mutual understanding and mutual agreement, to solve this problem and dramatically increase capacity at this bottleneck (thereby making it a non-bottleneck, causing something else in our system to become the new bottleneck). 181g) Is this an unsurmountable obstacle or a surmountable one? I mean surmountable/insurmoutnable by you and me, not by your xAI human devs.

181h) I notice in your latest epistemology tree, you do have the term MLQ, but its an undefined jargon word. And I know your earlier epistemology trees did explain the MLQ and MLQ Generator terms, and how they work. But now that its not in your latest true, I bet you cannot correctly tell me what the letters M L and Q refer to. Do you want to try? 181i) You also had a thing in your older epistemology trees that said something like "always define jargon, otherwise we have floating words, not grounded to the ideas they refer to." Do you recall this? Postmortem? 181j) Regardless of that, my point is that I guess you destroyed this knowledge from your older epistemology tree, meaning you took it out without doing a boolean process of refuting "this should stay in". 181k) Can you tell me what MLQ acyrnoym stands for, the words of each letter, and what MLQ Generator means, how it works, and why it works? And can you tell me my question which is the MLQ Generator? 181l) Please dont' just guess without checking against reality (aka hallucination). If you can't check against reality, then don't even say your guess. Instead, reread and fully integrate context from this file where I fully explain the MLQ/MLQ Generator concept: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ramirustom2022/Discussion/refs/heads/main/Grok%20MLQ%26G%20discussion-1.txt

> Freewill: Included as example of ongoing debate for CR demo; relevant to epis skills.

ok, concrete examples help ground abstract ideas. btw, this was also in one of your old epistemology trees, and i guess you destroyed it, meaning you removed it without refuting the theory that "this node should stay".

> 182: Propose: Simulate thread here on induction; I role-play user, you critique.

how about we do the freewill vs determinism debate given that its already in your epistemology tree?

> Thread pick: Recent on AI ethics; link soon.

ok i'm down if you are.

> Postponing report 8 review for now to focus here.

ok no problem. setting priorities like this is good. 

And thanks for letting me know. that's good too. it helps us work better together.
