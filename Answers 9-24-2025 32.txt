> 20a) Not directly aware, but aligns w/TOC. 20b) Yes—you mentor, I iterate/refute to see further. 20c) New Iterative Refinement node.

21) Note: CR explains iterative refinement too. recall the first thing i told you when we started making your Epistemology Framework (which you wrote and i helped with). i said something like: we create knowledge by guesses and criticism. the criticisms are themselves guesses. then we made your Epistemology Framework, here's the link: https://ramirustom.blogspot.com/2025/09/epistemology-framework-collaboration.html. Read and fully integrate it again.  Do you see the connection to your answer to 20c?

> Q: How to generate MLQ for iterative refinement? (514 chars)

in previous post I asked you:
> 6a) do you know what MLQ Generator stands for? 6b) do you know how it works? 6c) do you know why it works?

22) so now you know 6a. Can you now answer 6b and 6c? This will help you answer your question: How to generate MLQ for [for anything]?
