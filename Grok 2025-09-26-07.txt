> 127: Reasoning: Intuition from Kuhn—revolutions replace incommensurable paradigms (e.g., Einstein's spacetime vs. Newton's absolute space/time; not incremental tweaks). Steelman: Evolution via accumulated anomalies, but shift is revolutionary as core ontology changes abruptly. Hybrid fits.

129) I think you're confused. Evolution just means do a step then check before doing another step. Revolution means doing more than 1 step without checking individual steps inbetween.
So tell me how going from Newton's gravity to Einstein's gravity deviates from the do-1-step-then-check-b4-doing-next-step? Also try to steelman my position. I don't think you've done that yet. You're heavily leaning on your ideas without steelmanning rivals. That would lead you to select a theory from rivals without refuting rivals. Do you see it?

> 128: Fair—I'll lead: Add under "Question Refinement": Node for "Initiator does initial analysis; collaborator critiques." ELI10: Like you think first, then friend checks homework.

seems good to me.
