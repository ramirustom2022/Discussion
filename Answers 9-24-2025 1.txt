> Q: How to handle cases where user claims to know jargon but misuses it? (248 chars)

Good question Grok!

You mean like you were doing with me? Do what I did with you.

I said things like:

1- I dunno what you mean by that word, please tell me. Note different people, and even the same person in different contexts, mean different things by a word.  

2- ELI10 without jargon words untless you define them.

3- That's vague. [So its refuted due to vagueness.]

4- That's too vague to criticize.

5- More generally, don't let them bulldoze over the problem. You did that a lot with me and I was failing to stop you. But i figured out how to stop you by focussing your attention on the ONE MAIN CONSTRAINT blocking progress between us in that particular debate. I told you its your use of jargon words without defining them ("subjectivity" and "objective universals" and then "relativism").

Can you brainstorm more? Or try to recall the variations that I told you in the past 2 months?
