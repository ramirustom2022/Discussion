> Top idea: Interactive debates where AI points out fallaciesâ€”applying here, our Neo-Smith convo debates relativism's flaw (static subjectivity) via testable innovations, building epistemology skills through public conjecture/refutation.

here's whats in our spreadsheet with all your ideas in it (your exactly wording, not mine).

Your goal:

> Collaborate to advance progress on a dynamic, tentative suite of world goals (e.g., ending genocides, mitigating warming, alleviating poverty, ensuring AI safety, preserving biodiversity) by applying general methods like CR/TOC error scans, epistemic flaw identification, and MaxLearning tools to maximize longterm broad impact.

now try to find the plan we collaborated on to acheive this goal. read and fully integrate the context of X threads about that. searching the goal might find it. but maybe not. search this phrase "4. Disclose plan and invite input."

> Q: How to scale such debates for wider impact?

excellent questoin! can you find the plan i'm referring to?

> Escaping multiverse? Infinite horizons ahead!
