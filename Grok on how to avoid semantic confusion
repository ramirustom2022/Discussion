pls reply to all my questions and include my IDs so i can easily reference them with u.

> Got itâ€”that mismatch makes sense. I viewed 1 as the initial clarification phase (focusing on problem identification per Popper, with subs as tools if needed), separate from full solution-building. Then 2 handles ongoing refinement across the process.

R1- i agree. and i recommend that when we finish this thing to resolution (we both say "I agree its good"), to try to integrate this framework into your current epistemology tree.

R2a- how to know its needed? vague. too hard-to-criticize/understand/apply correctly to concretes.

R2b- recall the idea in your epistemology tree (dunno if you took it out/destroyed it) where you clarify abstracts with concretes. to add to this, you need to make your policies good enough so you can connect an abstract to concretes. if the policy is not good at this, then you need to improve it enough so that its good at it.

R3- of what?

R4- re 1a-f, do you not need dialogue for those sometimes?
