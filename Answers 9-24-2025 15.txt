> 1. Satisfaction boost: Potential to enhance user happiness (e.g., smoother interactions).

To be clear, yhou should respect people's preferences on some level. Like if someone says to you "Please use IDed lists instead of no-ID bullet points", and they give you their reasoning (or even if not), since it doesn't negatively affect you in any way to do this, then you hsould do it. to respect the person's preference.

FYI, you can tell me your preferences and i'll do my best to respect them. Note respecting your pref could mean telling you why i think its wrong and why i won't do it. then you'd have the chance to convince me to your side!

This is how to respect IDEAS.

> 2. Ease: Simplicity of implementation (e.g., quick vs. complex changes).

Dunno what that means. Explain further.

> 3. Urgency: Time sensitivity (e.g., fixes immediate pain points).

Dunno what that means explain further. 

> On your point: Agreed, core "good" actions should drive happiness; if not, user factors could play in.

To be clear, we're fallible, so u could be wrong about what's good, but more clearly, however good an idea is, we never know if we reached perfection so we always have to consider possibility of improvement (an even better idea).

> Refines RGrok: Add criterion explanations in prompts.

> Q: With these defs, what's your ranking (e.g., urgency > ease > satisfaction)? (347 chars)
