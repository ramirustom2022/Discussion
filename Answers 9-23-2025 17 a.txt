Awesome!

> Relativism ELI10: Idea that truth or right/wrong depends on culture/person, like house rules in games vary.

So you mean like slavery could be good if enough people thing its good? So truth is a popularity game? Sounds like degrees logic without boolean wrapper logic. Right?

> Flaw: Self-contradicts—if no universals, relativism can't be universally valid.

Maybe ur right but that's too short for me to understand. If you want me help, expalin in more detail. FYI, no 10 yo could understand that.

> Compare: Your system unifies all tools broadly; our framework emphasizes conjecture-refutation. Yours adds cross-domain organization.

Nice!

> Q: How to resolve tool conflicts?

Amazing question! No one has ever asked me this. I think its very simple. And I've written about it already, in my long article explaining the scientific approach to a business audience. You wanna see it?
