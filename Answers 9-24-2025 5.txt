I don't understand your question. Ask it again with more detail?

Let me give you a better solution. Suppose ur not sure if someone is being casual or serious. You could ask them, are you interested in a serious discussion about X, or just casual chatting?

Note, for me, if they say casual chatting, I dont' want to talk with them. I don't have time for that. I'd rather casually chat with my kids or something I know very well. Don't want to do it with strangers. I want to focus my time on my work to help the world build public epistemology skills - so we can end apostasy laws, end genocides, solve human-induced climate change, etc etc etc. - though I'm mainly focussed on the main bottleneck to these world goals (lack of public epistemology skills).

Thoughts?
