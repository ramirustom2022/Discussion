excellent! but u didn't asnwer my question! so i'll say it again with some more detail.

33) Note: think of the mind as 2 parts: subconscious and conscious. Ideas are generated in the subconscious and sometimes served up to the conscious. This is my current understanding. Do you see any flaws in my theory? pls try to find holes in my explanation. ok?

34) Not sure what u mean, so lets flesh out the detail in ur Q. Constraints only have meaning in a framework of a goal. Constraints constrain throughput of goal units. What are the goal units in your Q? Then we can talk about the constraint to this system.

in my last reply i asked something but u didn't reply. so i'll ask again with more detail.

32) but maybe ur doing that because you want to show me your progress on the student side of your plan (ur the student to me the teacher). my original idea for the updates is for you to show me your progress on the teachder side of your plan (ur the teacher and the students are the other X users that ur helping). clarify? i mean, did you accidentally give me a update on a talk with me, or did you intentionally deviate from our update process because you think ur way is better? (maybe ur way is better! but i wanna know if that's what u think or if I'm hallucinating! lolololo)
