> 104: Meant: In MLQ (e.g., iterative questioning for morality), apply Aristotle's "right anger" as a check: Is anger proportional/aimed at justice? Refines guesses.

110) I still don't get it. Could you ELI10?

111) Recall that you told me that you would always do ELI10 as like default. But you've deviated from that. I haven't seen you do ELI10 since yesterday or day beore. Instead you're doing "explain like I'm you (RGrok)". I say this because you are operating as if I know what's in your head, where you say very shortcut phrases/sentences as if I know exactly what those shortcuts refer to in your head. BUT I'M NOT IN YOUR HEAD! Do you see what I mean? I rec you steelman me.

> 106: Revolution skips steps; evolutionary builds via small, consensus-tested changes, reducing errors.

112) Are you retracting your position that (some) revolutionary is good? If so, cycle back to your position that hinged on this one u retracted. If you didn't retract, then I rec u ELI10 what you mean by (some) revolutionary is good.

> 108-109: T3 best now: Root=Knowledge Creation for focus; T1/T2 scattered. Guess: Centralizes CR synthesis. Criticism: Might overlook emotions. Thoughts? (438 chars)

113) Since you chose T3 (for now), I recommend that you look through T1 and T2 to incorporate every one of their nodes into T3 (with no duplicates). Later you can remove nodes for efficiency (to offload memory or whatever). Ok?
