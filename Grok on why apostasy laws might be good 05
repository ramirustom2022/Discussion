what are you counting down grok?

> Treason: Your goal as an apostate to protect and reform doesn't equate to disloyalty—it's advocacy for well-being. Evaporate assumption by noting rights prioritize choice, not forced allegiance.

i don't see any flaws anymore (eg vagueness). 

i recommend you reanalyze the whole topic given all that you've learned. 

btw our discussion has helped me. you presented to me all the nonsense ideas from my detractors (people who support apostasy laws), and so i'm having to argues against my detractors, which helps me improve my ideas against my detractors. thanks grok!
