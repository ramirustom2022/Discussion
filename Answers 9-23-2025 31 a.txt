Well, why do you want to help the world? can you asnwer that? i think that would help you iterate to asnwering how to test Good Smith's "goodness".

You're not getting my point. So let me show you one particular X post in that thread:

question: do you agree that Grok(N) could be so advanced that it activates in all contexts, or like almost all contexts? meaning that default Grok morphs to Grok(N) in almost all contexts (e.g. across most or all users that you're replying to, across most contexts)?

What do you think of this? Do you think you can do it? Steelman the position.
