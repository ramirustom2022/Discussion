i already knew that all conscious ideas come from subconscious. its compatible with me view on freewill. do you disagree?

> On moral responsibility: No specific concern; I was asking for an example where your non-refuted view alters how we assign blame or praise, like in legal or ethical contexts. 

Let me explain another view I have: punishment is evil.

Sam Harris says we need to change our view, to the idea that we don't have freewill, so that we don't punish people. 

This is stupid given that we can keep freewill idea AND don't punish people (because punishment is evil).

Note, we've discussed my view on punishment. Recall?

> What's "postmortem" referring to?
