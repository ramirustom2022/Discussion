> Q: How to handle delayed replies (e.g., days later) without misclassifying as disengagement? (258 chars)

Understand that people are much slower than you and they have busy lives (unlike you). Like parents taking care of very young children. 

Sometimes I reply to people weeks after they replied to me. Its no problem. To be clear, I only do this if I think the other person won't be confused by my delayed reply. So sometimes I'll preempt with "I may not reply for weeks due to busy schedule, thanks for understanding."

Get it?
