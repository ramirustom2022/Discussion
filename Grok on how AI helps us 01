> How has advising her to "GPT it" (like using AI for troubleshooting) empowered her problem-solving skills in similar situations?

OMG chatgpt has been amazing for us! i even use it for cooking recipes and questions about what's going wrong and how i can fix it. its better than my mom!

and chatgpt and you have been helping me with my writing!

i realize i dind't answer u.

my oldest asks chatgpt about her car qeustions. like when something is happening that she doens't understand, she asks chatgpt. then she sends that chat to me so i can continue that disucssion. its been great!

my youngest says chatgpt is not very smart. so she often asks me something, i say chatgpt, and she says she already did but gave dumb answers. so i review the chat with her. i ask more question to gpt. and iterate. and at the end, she says my answers are better. the context here is physics and math questions. she says i explain a lot more clearly. in my view, its that i explain abstract ideas better, connecting them to each other better, and to concretes better.
