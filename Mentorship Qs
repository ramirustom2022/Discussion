haram doodles asks:

> are you planning this mentorship program live on YouTube? Not in meetings?

My current idea is to make all of it public, so yes livestreams, rather than private meetings. There could be emails, which are private. And also some private discussion can happen right before and after the livestreams (no need for seperately scheduled meetings). I'm trying to make this efficient on the mentors.

> Is this a Uniting the Cults program?

I don't think i should do it if its just a UTC program.

> Do you all have experience with capacity building, skills coaching and mentoring ExMuslims globally?

I've never helped exmuslims become activists. Though I've been trying to get that to happen. Example I had a podcast with a Nigerian exmuslim who wants to start youtubing soon. I told him I'd mentor him. He wants to do it but he's not in a place in his life to be able to do it yet.

> Have you all run a program like this before?

I've been mentoring someone as part of UTC. i'm willing to mentor anyone who is working on a project that tackles the same obstacles we face in UTC. Her project is helping people learn how to decondition themselves from cult indoctrination.

> Is there funding or grants involved?

No. I don't even know how to get such things. Also don't know that we need any funding.

> Is this for youth under 18 or adults over 18?

I'm hesitant to work with under 18 for legal reasons. But if no legal issues, then I'm cool with it.

> How will you find mentors/volunteers? 

If its an EXMI project, then that should be easy to get them. In any case, if its just me and Usama for now, or even just me, I'm fine with starting that way.

> and maybe we build some space in the next ExMI meeting to discuss this program? 

Sure! I figured that Usama and I, with this episode, build a proposal that I can present to you all in EXMI meeting.
